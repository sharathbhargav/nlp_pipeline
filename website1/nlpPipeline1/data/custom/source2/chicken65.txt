Then add 1 egg and mix in completely-(Egg coats the meat and keeps the juices in)
Heat oil in a frying wok or kadhai-Add chicken pieces few at a time(Do not crowd the kadhai) and fry until lightly golden brown-drain and remove on a paper towel
To make the sauce (This does not need to be very salty-so control salt ):-

Heat 2-3 teaspoon of oil in a pan, add cumin seeds, chopped ginger, and garlic and saute until fragrant.
Then add chopped chilies, curry leaves,1 teaspoon of ginger/garlic paste, remaining pepper powder, chili powder, salt, chili/garlic paste, aji-no-moto, red color, cumin powder and mix. Cook for a few minutes.
Add a little water and then add chicken to this paste and toss lightly.
