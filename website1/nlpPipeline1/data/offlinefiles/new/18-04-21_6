This cat has glitched the matrix. 
Why scratch with two paws when you can scratch with all four simultaneously 
If I'm day dreaming and think to hard about the mechanics of how people walk this ends up happening and my vision falls apart.
And 4x4 is nothing without good tires.
Cats step with both left paws at the same time?

First time I watched I didn't realize the gif had started over so when the same guy walked past the X-Files theme started playing in my head
It's just a kitty doing its daily cardio, leave it alone 
There seems to be a glitch in the matrix. 
Would love to see what the folks over at r/AnimalTextGifs could do with this

Otherwise, how do you explain Michael Jackson in the body of a cat?
Real life lag is one of the scariest thing in my opinion. Thank god it doesn't happen

So fucking funny being on a leash.
Is it tied on it's neck?

That doesn't look comfortable. Or am I missing something here.
That you MJ?
All these fucking jokes when really the sentiment ought to be concern. Manners don't cost nothing. Admonish me with downvotes.

√Öh, so that's how it's happening. Nice spot.
Even looking for it it was still hard to see. Nice catch. 
Good catch, I thought the cat was just moon walking. 
Didnt see the leash until meow
Thank you. I had no idea what was happening 
Michael Jackson's cat
I‚Äôve seen this gif loads and now I notice, why now?
So someone is playing BF1 tethered to their smart phone via mobile hot spot?
I didn't see it till I got suspicious the cat was tied with fishing line or similar to create the effect, then realized it was just on a leash...
Yeah I'm still not seeing it at all...
thanks. my average brain couldnt compute.
Or is he rubber banding?
Damn. I was hoping he would become Moonwalk Cat. 
Took me a bit to realize.
Damn it, it‚Äôs ruined for me now
Damn. I enjoyed this way more before being told it was on a leash. Poor kitty?
A cat being held in a leash always makes me so sad.
I didn‚Äôt see this video till I watched it.
Most helpful comment of the day ^
aint gonna get pet unless u got six pack abs

Exactly what I thought.  MJ's reincarnation

stupid leash glitch
Once upon a time i had a lan party with my friends. We all were connected to my iphones lan for like 5 mins before we could get a proper internet. Tried to play some overwatch and had 16000 ping. Yes it was over ten thousand. I was *10 seconds late*
Bootloops can be catastrophic. 
Came here for the Jamiroquai reference!
No different then a dog being on a leash other then that its a cat.. It's on a leash not a noose. Cat people might like to go on walks with their pets too. Store: No pets allowed.  Sorry Mr. Fluffers be right back.
everything is animal abuse    
having a pet is animal abuse    
petting your cat is animal abuse    
kissing your dog is animal abuse    
Just... Don't touch anything
This isn't abuse. It's not in pain. It's not struggling. It's not being starved. It's a derpy cat learning how a leash works. Get the fuck over yourself.
Oh shut up
You mean leashing your pet outside a store while you go inside at night and not in the sun is animal abuse?
Nice spot indeed.

It's literally invisible in the lower half.
Yeah I almost upvoted it and then I noticed my dog does this all the time when I walk too slow. 
Me too. I was so confused.

This will never have enough upvotes.

You can see it being pulled taut if you look at the where the person in the background crouches
Cats allowed to freely roam outside only have a life expectancy of 2-5 years. Leashing it seems harsh but I guess is a good way to give it some fresh air without risking its safety. 
Would you rather it be stuck inside a house? Or left outside to be hunted/run over and cause damage to the local ecosystem?
What?
Some things are truly best unknown. The world is a little less bright to meow. 
or maybe someone paused his game and now this is just the walking animation they do on the status screen
The invisible philly wall strikes again
Are you O K Kitty


There is no leash
One time leage shit itself SO HARD my friend was getting 40k ping. It was stupid halarious because by the time she was able to get decent ping the game had already ended xD
Tracer irl?
Weird. I get around 130ms ping from my Hotspot. It's actually not bad. 
Leashloops in this case.

Finally got it on my fifth loop.

Meonmyownwalking
How does this not have more upvotes lol
Oh wow now you've pointed it out I don't know how I missed it. Thanks!
Yeah, when you think like this it doesn‚Äôt sound so bad. Better be safe than sorry.
Yep. My mom has never kept an outside cat for more than 2 years. Most met very gruesome fates. The only thing that's sadder is that my siblings get so attached to each one. 
Yea, outdoor cats are actually pretty horrible for local ecosystems.

My mom found a good trade in her cats, they lived indoors for years and when they finally got the chance to go outside they pretty much only go to the porch or maybe out into the yard a bit. They stick close to home. That might just be her cats though. I am sure some would just take the fuck off.
Or could be a glitch they claim is a feature and not a bug
like pokemon blue when they just bob up and down
You've been kit by
I once got 100 Dillion ping in pubg and the game ended while I was still parachuting in.
It was probably terrible because they had several people on the Hotspot. I'm not positive though. 
Please tell us how the cat is being mistreated?
Chances are, animals aren‚Äôt allowed in the store.  Please don‚Äôt be an asshole to shopkeepers.  The cat can deal with being outside for ten minutes on a leash.  The shopkeeper shouldn‚Äôt have to sweep up fur and (possibly) clean up messes because someone disobeyed their store rules.

EDIT: it seems to be under construction, so not only might animals not be allowed, it‚Äôs straight up DANGEROUS to put them in there.
I'm still going, probably see it soon...
Layla, you got me on my knees,
Layla, I‚Äôm begging darling please,

Took me far too many loops before I saw it
I let mine out onto the deck (backyard is non existent)  
If I were to look away for 2 minutes she's garunteed to leave the yard.
You‚Äôve been cat by
Damn lol that's one hell of a ping
I've seen this a few times but now I'm starting to think it is mistreatment. They don't have many laws to protect animals. there is someone standing there filming while this cat is clearly trying to make progress. Not sure if this is abuse but think how much this person cares if they will put them on a short leash
Last time something like this was posted, all of the comments were calling this mistreatment. Weird how those same sentiments are now being massively downvoted.

No, they're actually trying to entice the cat to get something it wants that's off-screen. It's not animal abuse but it's still mean.
Look at the part of the street that's illuminated by an orange glow.

You'll see a leash that runs diagonally from the wall to the cat. 
Got to relax your eyes
A smooth kitty cat
A SMOOOOTH kittybowl
I get infinity ping all the time. I am unable to play video games.
> They don't have many laws to protect animals.

You don't seem to know about laws against animal abuse then... They're kind of designed to protect animals.
My Python is constantly trying to escape his 50 gallon tank I've made into a habitat for him. I don't let him free roam unattended because he's a domesticated snake and would not survive in the wild. Do you consider that animal abuse? I don't think putting a cat on a leash is very smart, but if you don't have any other choice it's better than leaving the cat off the leash and letting it wander. 
Took me a while because I was expecting it to be lower. Look at shoulder height of the people in the background. Coming down from there edge of the door frame. Hard to spot on a small mobile screen. 
Thanks Magic Eye
.......... a kittybowl?
From what I've heard Asian country's don't have the same protection 

Either way don't tie your cat outside a shop 
I FOUND IT. Jesus I‚Äôve never felt such relief. 
My cat would love that, though, I might. I've taken him on walks a few times and he walks better on a leash than many dogs.
You've never had to piss so bad while drunk, or otherwise, that it makes you audibly groan? Or is that how you felt
Well look at it's tail, I don't think this cat is enjoying it whatsoever 
Yeah, he isn't, but it's not like it's harming him. There's worse things than that...
