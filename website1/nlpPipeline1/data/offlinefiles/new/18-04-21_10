Seal gets inside shark net and shows off his fishing skills

I love the guy who just starts clapping at the end
That is one amazing fish seeking missile 
Fast as lightning underwater, as wobbly as a jelly on the ground.
Clearly these people have never seen Arrested Development.
That's amazing! Those people just got a show for going to the beach on a nice day... and I've quarantined myself to my cave which allows me to watch such things on Reddit. üòÑ

What a time to be alive!
Before I read the title, the couple seconds of the massive, dark, lightning fast figure underwater scared the shit out of me. 

I‚Äôd be acting exactly like those kids grabbing their boards‚Äînopeing tf outta there. 

The dude who just stood there and let the seal hunt around him has balls the size of planets. 
Looks like that shark net has a bad seal
"Seal Team Six has acquired target. In pursuit."
‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt bite my dick please don‚Äôt bite my dick please don‚Äôt bite my dick please don‚Äôt bite my dick.‚Äù

- that guy, probably 
How‚Äôd it get through the net? And if it‚Äôs getting through, what about sharks?
Bar beach Narooma 
Fairly certain that is a sea lion, you can tell by the longer front flippers.
I want to see the full video :D
I love it when the guy gets splashed. 

‚ÄúOutta the way, tubby, this is official SEAL business!‚Äù
Definitely a sealion 
That's incredible how fast and skillfull they swim 
That would be so cool to be that guy beside the sea lion.
Sea Lion
This would be a far better to watch at a zoo or aquarium than the shows they tend to put on.
[Fun fact!  There is an infection known is seal finger caused by seal bites or coming into contact with seal bones that can render fingers unusable.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_finger)
That seal definitely wasn't awkward.
They are so damn fast. Really makes you think about how fast Great White Sharks are
Sea lion*
Poor baby Buster...
DAMN NATURE YOU SCARY!
Anybody else notice the woman with the big Eyes in the red swimsuite at the beginning?
This is so cool and exciting when it's sunny out and the water is clear.

The only time it happened to me (except with a harbor seal), it was a gloomy day in maine and the water was all murky and full of sediment.SO it was kind of terrifying. Me and 2 others saw a fin off in the distance, and then I felt what I can only really describe as something swimming close, and turning on a dime near me - sending big walls of moving currents towards my dangling feet.  

As I started to turn around to paddle in, the cutest little harbor seal popped up in front of me and spun around in the water and spun like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp-52d4HxtY .  I peed in my wetsuit about 30 seconds later. I love seals.  
Definitely a sea lion. Those big flippers give it away, and how he can walk on them.

That looks like a sea lion, not a seal.
Isn‚Äôt that a sea lion?
The dude applauding the sea lion at the end was my favorite. Stop egging him on!
damn those things can swim. they‚Äôre no easy prey for sharks
He must be fishing for compliments.
Somebody tell me when r/animaltextgifs picks this up. It's going to be good. 
Who the fuck takes a seal to the beach?

Not Seaworld, that's for sure!
gosh dang, I thought that was sped up. seals are fast, man
Well, after the ban on seals going clubbing, they have to find some way to entertain themselves. 
for several seconds I thought it was shark
Shark Net HOO HA HA
/u/yoursawkwardlyyy heyyy wanna swim with seals? Lol
That guy with a fishing pole is a dick for fishing that close to people swimming.
Nature is m√©tal 
How about you don‚Äôt stand in the water next to an actively hunting 200 pound predator
Fast as fast can be, you'll never catch me after I escaped SeaWorld!
[run buddy!](https://youtu.be/dooHhHhcIOw?t=4)
Good boy!
Everyone loves the king of the sea
God I love seals. Best animal on this planet, cam't change my mind
Man, what an asshole...‚ÄùHey humans, I can fish without the need for specially designed tools!‚Äù
I always heard that these were jellyfish nets
Visit Sea World before Sea World visits you.
Guy in the middle smiling like this is the highlight of his life
Did that dude catch the seal?
He finally got his fish!
Holy fuck, those things can move. 
Just wait for the shark to get through the shark net and showcase its skills
This is kickass.  Love seals!
That's a seal? Holy crap, that looks like a dolphin/shakr! 
Seal stole that dudes fish 
Looks like he plucked it out of the air
that seal is fucking talented holy shit
Ummm.. if that fat thing can make it through the net, can‚Äôt a shark make it??
I‚Äôm impressed!
Fish should've swam between the man's legs. 
kinda like a dog really
Well if a seal that large can get through the shark net... Then... 
Seal 1 - Human 0 
  
Seals are clearly better at fishing.
So if a seal can get inside the shark net...

*Dhuuuuuh dhooommm*
All I need to hear at the end of this is Ed from Ed, Edd, and Eddy screaming "FOUND IT!" and laughing.
i dont know much about seals, but have they ever been prone to hurt humans? i know i would have stood there like the guy in blue shorts and cheered on the seal, just curious on whether they are known for hurting humans in general.
I love him 
It's like getting a nice goal in Rocket League.
Can I assume this is Australia?
If I were a merman, I would totally have a pet waterdog

Ohhhh! He fucking got it! That was awesome!
Seal gets inside shark net and shows off its food to everyone
I hope this isn't China.  The chinese would just throw bricks at the seal to get it to do tricks

http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-20/kangaroo-dies-in-chinese-zoo-after-visitors-throw-rocks/9682220
Could you imagine if he breached the surface with you dick in his snout?
Good work sea doggo
Here is the seal showed how to fish, and not run with a fishing rod along the shore.
I want to see more now
Anyone has the actual video? I wanna see what happens after, the seal gets the fish and is all dog like proud of himself with his catch above water and it just cuts off..
That‚Äôs Narooma, NSW - bar beach
Can we just officially rename them sea-dogs?  
The seal population has had quite a devastating effect on other fish species.  So much misinformation and celebrity figures blindly supporting anti-sealing groups without knowing the facts.
First thread I opened this morning. Half asleep...

Was expecting the musician....

Back to bed. 
I'm a shark I'm a shark....ahhh fuck it, I'm just happppppy
I think my favorite part is that you can see the fish zoom by. Little Nemo swimming for his life!
Are these nets specifically for great whites and oh my they get that close to the beach?
Guy with the fishing pole is trying to low-key catch a seal tho lol
seals are like the ocean equivalent of cats
Forget a zombie apocalypse, if seals ever turn on humans we are done for.
Does anyone have an idea where this was filmed or what type of fish that was?
Honestly great camera work, you see both the fish and he follows the seal around until the end!
Then I suppose a shark could get inside the net, too.
This is my hometown, so weird seeing it on here. 
Go Seally..it's yo birthday!!
That shark was waiting a long time for this to finally happen
That final back-twisting lunge towards his fishy-delight made my sciatica ping. 
Love the dude trying to fish the seal lmao
If a seal got in... couldn't a shark?
I'm surprised no one filmed the rendition of "Kiss from a rose" he did afterwards.
If a seal can get inside the net, why can‚Äôt a shark?
I hope he remembered how to get back out of the shark net.  
Seals, the D-O-DOUBLE-G‚Äôz of the sea
r/zoomies
Is it just me or is fishing near swimmers a bad idea?
Makes me want to go fishing again until I remember it was nothing like this.
/r/NatureIsFuckingLit
Why is there a guy with a phishing rod next to swimmers adults and children?
I'm impressed by that guy just standing there. He must have a lot of awards from Army. 
It's kind of crazy that food is getting scarce enough for them not to care about getting close to humans at all
Seal zoomies
There is a full segment on this type of activity in one of the Blue Planet 2 episodes. Looks awesome from over head views. 
Maybe someone should seal that shark net...
Loose seal!!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud-oZoDl_7Q
Is someone holding their phone while in the water?
What a show-off! 
Mammals, FTW
I like to think the guy with the fishing rod was indignant that the seal was stealing his catch - "hey! that's my fish!"
Why is there a guy running with a fishing rod? Is he fishing in a place where people are swimming?
That's nice big fish
Fresh and wiggly  
That read at the end.

This seal should play rocket leauge
I think its a bit odd that there was a guy with a fishing rod in front of the camera.  Like, did someone tell you it was a good idea to throw out hooks where there are people and children swimming?
Shark nets in places like these where people are swimming are 99.9999% for the mental comfort of the people there as shark attacks on people are exceedingly rare.
I hope he manages to get out of the shark net. A lot of marine critters get tangled in them and die.
The experience of a life time for the big dude. 
This is amazing.
It's a good thing fish can't scream
Very dangerous over short distances!
If a seal can get through....
Of course someones fishing in the family beach lol.
This is the coolest thing I have seen all day. Thanks for sharing.
So if a dolphin can get inside, what about a shark?
Guy with fishing pole. "Dammit" 
Guy in water "High 5" 
What kind of asshole is fishing when there are people nearby? I‚Äôm talking about the guy with the fishing rod
At first I thought the fish was also being reeled in by fisher guy. So when it looped around that shirtless dude with zero fucks I thought he was getting fishlined for sure.
Umm NEWS FLASH seals can only get jobs catching fish now that the circus circuit has declined...this is like posting a story about a carpenter who goes into a lumber yard and builds something...

Now if the seal had shown off his dance moves or skateboard skills I'd be impressed, but hell I can catch fish.
That great footage, and my first thought was : if a seal can get inside the shark net... hahaa :\
That's Jervis bay, in Australia. Great place to see the seals. But I've never seen one this lively
This camera work is amazing
But if a seal can get in .....
*sea lion
Should have shown off his people murdering skills.
Fishing rod guy looked like he was trying to catch the fish before it
H U N T E R B O Y E
It‚Äôs a good job that fish was there and it didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúplay‚Äù with the people...
Just after this video a Chinese tourist threw a brick at the seal killing it.  R.I.P. Martin the seal.
Wonderful! That is amazing!
That hott lady in red...
What is that fat seal in blue pants doing standing in the middle?
[deleted]
Im just commenting for Karma points lol. But the guy with the fishing pole looks a little too excited

Shit I'd toss in an air punch! 
That was his seal impression. 
 So human of him. 
Later tonight he'll be telling all the other seals "there we're people EVERYWHERE, then the fish swims around this Rodney Dangerfield lookin' dude and I snatch it up out of the water in my jaws like Yaaaarggh!! and they were both in awe and amazement.


The other seals be all "Fucking turn it up, Gary!! Must have been another Magikarp eh?" Vanished before you could square up again.


Not going to lie, that would have been me had I been there.  I humanize animals too much and expect them to appreciate something like cheering lol
Please clap.
was the guy with the fishing pole trying to save that fish
That clap sealed the deal. 
Lol I started clapping just watching this
Best vacation ever
Once you've been marked there is no escaping the Seal of Death...  unless you're a pilchard or a poacher the threat assessment is low.
That‚Äôs how you spot the American.
As if the seal would understand what the clapping is about.

The seal be like "b*tch I'm just eating my lunch"
I always wondered who was the first guy to clap in human history. Everyone probably thought he was a fucking lunatic. 
I'd probably clap too, that was awesome.
Arf arf arf!!!
That seal‚Äôs name? Albert Einstein.
Unrequited love must hurt 
BRAVO SIR, BRAVO
Thanks for pointing that out! 
Dude is like "Nature! Fuck yeah!"
Time to bring out the Great White. 
Stay on target...
Nope.
Sea lions are surprisingly quick on land too.
Watched loads of animal videos in my life, but I never knew how fast they were until gettin g to see this video next to a human for comparison. Wow.
What, is that guy a pro swimmer or something?
And never came near a human in that whole chase. 
Loose seal!
It‚Äôs okay. A seal would never attack a human. Unless it somehow got a taste for mammal blood.
I'm a little sad this isn't the top comment
Truly amazing. I dont even see a reason to leave the house anymore.
normies at the beach lol

enjoy your wet undies
Well, when you go out on a nice day, you might see something awesome, or you might end up feeling lonely and anxious and out of your element, and then come home and feel kind of crappy because you didn't use enough sun screen or something. I don't think getting a seal show is that common. Probably not worth the risk. 
What disease do you have
Get the fuck up 

Go outside

Do dope shit
Youve seen that seal catch that fish more times in that looped gif than they ever saw at their day at the beach. 
Seals were often around when I used to surf. They're fine in the water where they're comfortable, sometimes they would even play with us. Best to keep away from them on land though, they can get a bit grumpy if you get too close.
Excuse me, those are his breasts
Either balls or tourist-at-the-beach levels of awareness 
Chuckling at the fact he may be eaten, second the balls the size of planets 
He looks like their cousin. He‚Äôs probably thinking, ‚ÄúSee! I was built for the ocean!‚Äù
r/Thalassophobia
> The dude who just stood there and let the seal hunt around him has balls the size of planets.

More like he's just intelligent enough not to panic over nothing.
Eehhh it'd clearly hunting and focused on that. Your just an obstacle. Like a rock. Nobody expects the rocks to run away. Not to mention it's way faster than you and you do not get any to step into its path. Best to hold still and let it finish it's business. As long as the fish doesn't say jump into you pants then your balls will be fine. 
Yep, it looks fishy to me. 
Wow you weren't lion
Take your upvote and get out
And put a beard on the fish :D
That's too small to be considered a snack even.  -the seal, probably
why would it does his dick smell of fish?
‚Äú‚ÄòScuse me!!! Your kid bit my dick!‚Äù ‚ÄúJohn Edmund Mulaney! Did you bite this nice man‚Äôs dick?‚Äù
I visit this beach regularly, it could easily go on the rocks surrounding the net and go around, as well as possibly go around on the beach side 

another possibility is it just jumped over the net.  Very few shark species can breach the water.  They only do so when attacking from the below their prey and a vast majority of the breaches only happen off the coast of South Africa.  

Seals however, like dolphins, can breach the watch to jump over something blocking their way if its low enough. 
Best beach to go to as a kid. Still is for a casual swim.
Never thought that Narooma would end up on reddit lol 
It could be a sea lion, or it could be you lyin'.
He then stood up from the water and sang Kiss from a rose and the women started fainting
Yeah, something isn't right about this, and the dude running through with a fishing pole makes me think it's him. No way that fish should have been caught in the middle of nothing like that. Sure if it cornered it against the rocks, but in the middle of nothing? Fish are fucking fast.
The seal was probably thinking he is. Bigger predator.

And he‚Äôs right.
Pronounced this like "scallion".
A SEALion?
**#MAMMALIANPRIDE**
Or we could just not imprison these creatures against their will, how about that?
You need to watch the show in valencia. Wowsa
Unsubscribe
 So you‚Äôre saying that being bitten by a seal can often result in losing use of a hand.
Super neat! A 'new' disease that they're just figuring out is caused by an unknown bacteria. It's like being a scientist 100 years ago when you have some basic tests, some likely candidates, and need to narrow down the cause. 
Does that mean you can't make Seal soup?
Really makes you think about how fast Orcas are
Just went back to confirm. Good catch, my dude!
Noticed that straight away. More of her big hanging eyes please!
First thing i noticed too, I'm glad I'm not the only one.
> red

Big Yes. First thing that caught my eye. Is there a reddit for people like us?
I would actually go to a Movie theater to watch *this* one.
Da fuq does this have to do with anything? 
If seals were fighter jets, sharks would be air to air missiles.
It would be a privilege 
I've found a value to convert:

- 200.0lb is equal to 90.72kg or 495.74 bananas
The guy with the fishing pole? 
Seals are far more maneuverable than most sharks, and the nets are designed to keep the big ones out, little ones could still slip through if they find a gap. Then again a dog shark or similar little bitey fella won't hurt you much,
An earlier commenter said they were familiar with the beach, and the seals get around the net by climbing over rocks on the shore.
Doesn't matter, 1 shark sighting can ruin the beach business whether it attacks someone or not. 
It's not a dolphin. It's clearly a lama. 
The seal could walk on land around it lol
Sharks don't usually walk on land.
Bad bot ? 
This is definitely an air punch situation. 
Whoah the real madlad
[Here ya go!](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=air+punch&qpvt=air+punch&FORM=IGRE)
Air punching while on waist level water may fail pretty hard, lol
Walrus Punch!
‚ÄúArf arf‚Äù he whispered to himself. 
The seal sealed the deal.
/r/likeus 
I'd clap for the fish. finally out of his meaningless prison of constant suffering called life. 
Running away makes you look like prey anyway. 
"We know."
Theyre one giant muscle with flippy flappers.
Is this a sea lion or a seal? Because yes, a sea lion on land is fast enough, but a seal is slow as shit.
I believe they can get aggressive too, scary thought. 
But we will fight them on the land.  And in the air.  
  
But never in the sea.
Post says seal.
How fast do they go?  

In the unlikely event I'm racing a sea lion for money, I want to know how much to bet.
We have them on land too, we call them land sea lions. 
Surprising for their appearance yes. But they would struggle to keep up with with someone walking at a brisk pace.
[deleted]
Compared to humans, yeah. We are really slow animals 
Nope. 

Not that quick.
and they are comparatively slow, as far as ocean critters go. 
He sideswipes the big guy.  You can see him flinch a little just after it goes by.  

That would be incredibly cool to be standing there.
Lol, no, dude almost got taken out by a 300 pound muscle. I‚Äôm sitting here laid up after knee surgery, fat white guy was about 12 inches from being in the same situation as me!
"I'm not afraid of her anymore!"
Yes?
Gotta watch out for Lucilles
Please go fish where you belong
**I'm not afraid of Lucille!**

It‚Äôs the only place to get a decent meal
If we don't leave the house, the world will flourish!


In all seriousness, people talk shit about people that want to go to Mars, but dude, I'm already in a closed environment 24/7.

I'm just trying to turn down gravity.
In your defense, the beach is terrible.  
And all that rough irritating sand I hate.
huh?
Seals are a lot like dogs
Wouldn‚Äôt the fact that seals are around you be comforting too? Wouldn‚Äôt it kind of hint towards the fact that there‚Äôs probably no sharks around you?

Edit: I recently just moved within an hour drive to an ocean, you guys haven‚Äôt helped me get over my fear of sharks. Damn Spielberg!
Yeah, but he didn‚Äôt have the caption to tell him it was a seal! 
No one likes anchovies.
Ah okay 
Where is this beach?
Yeah seals can easily get around on land when a shark is much less adept at land based travel. 

They a dumb and stupid on land but they can and do often do it. IIRC during breeding season. 
What are you suggesting actually happened here? What did the dude with the fishing rod do exactly?

> Fish are fucking fast.

Sorry but did you see how fast this seal was?
Are you saying it‚Äôs unrealistic for a seal to catch a fish?
If you're implying the guy with the rod had the fish connected, then it would have wrapped around the guy in the middle, who shows no reaction.
Well, that's not what I meant.
Seals are pretty fast and Fish probably was already scared due to the presence of so many humans in water and it was surrounded by shark net, so probably got tired after running away from seal
Nah it‚Äôs totally fine you‚Äôre just being stupid. üëç
Most animals at good zoos are not "imprisoned against their will", they can't be released into the wild for different reasons. So the option is to give it a decent life and study it or kill it. Your choice. 
I say the same about humans.
good luck getting wealthy white people to give a fuck about the preservation of natural habitats without any way for them to see animals in person. 
Yeah that one is pretty impressive!
Shut up Leonard! I talked to your son on Family Day. I know all about your gambling.
LOOSE SEAL!
It is neat! The explanation I read for why it isn‚Äôt well understood  is that those that would normally catch it work in remote areas with no access to medical care  and would just amputate the finger as standard course.  It‚Äôs so rare for people to be in contact with seals like that in modern society  that medicine just never has had the opportunity to study it.
That happens all the time even today.
Good bot

Maybe even an air punch jump spin
Definitely a Hawaiian Punch situation
Oh ha ha
Im slightly suspicious that you are, in fact, a seal, "Bryan."
stop complaining, you'll be dead soon enough

Sea lion. Flippers are pretty big for a seal.

Yeah, don't startle them, especially if you find yourself between them and the sea. 

Easy to get close without noticing too when they're basking on rocks.
they rape penguins :C

I don't think he did sideswipe him. I think the big guy was attempting to get out of the way.

Fun fact:

The  Dutch word for Seal is actually Seadog (Zeehond)
If a bunch of seals swam around me it would instantly hit me that other predatory eyes are watching me now. Cold gazes from the deep below. They watch. They wait.

Possibly. Could also mean a 20-foot Great White is lurking far beneath you and might mistake you for lunch as he breaches
"Sharks don't eat humans, they eat seals. Oh look, seals!"
Or it means sharks are attracted to where you are..
Plot twist...the sharks can too. 
Bar Beach, Narooma. South coast of New South Wales, Australia. Great spot for snorkeling!
Yes, seal was faster. 
/r/nothingeverhappens
This is my question too
Plot twist: Rod guy was fishing for seals. 
>at good zoos

Exactly. There are very few of those in the world.
If they're wealthy, they can afford to travel to see the animals in person in their natural habitat.
Is it online? 
that's a lil too much
Don‚Äôt shoryuken the poor animal

I‚Äôm not gunna do the ‚Äútwirl‚Äù. I might do the spin though

Oh, look at mister athletic over here, guys.
Pretty sure that's a shoryuken..
Perhaps even an air punch jump spin land in half jumping jack 
This keeps happening! That‚Äôs why I chose this username!
And I'll pray for you to not be, my good sir. 
That's a really fun sub!
That music felt like I was playing SMRPG all over again.
You can't convince me that's not a human in a walrus suit
Definitely a walrus.
And it's front propelled. Seals use their back flippers for propulsion, sea lions use the front. 
And penguins rape penguins... must suck to be a penguin

Dolphins (and even whales, IIRC) have been documented doing this to protect humans and other mammals from predators like sharks. But do seals?

What is it with the British colonies and the UK and having insanely long names for places. It‚Äôs like I am Thor, son of Odin, keeper of the 9 realms, Prince of Asgard, a planet in the whatever galaxy, may I take your order. Are they that bad at geography that they need super specific locations. I mean 90% of austrialia is uninhabited, I think it‚Äôs be prett easy to say, the beach. Or for England blah blah blah blah blah blah blah on blah on the River Thames 
Which are the bad ones, so we can all stay away from them?
I mean wealthy compared to africans, south americans, and other people who live in countries whose natural resources haven't been raped beyond repair yet. I don't mean wealthy compared to other white people.

If you're 12 or under it's alright, adults are not legally allowed to show that much glee.
Probably would be cooler for an out-of-water air punch situation. It‚Äôs a little slow in water.

just a wee bit 
I once saw a video of a penguin being eaten alive *from the ass* by some bigger bird of prey. Of all the gorey shit I've seen, that hit me the hardest for some reason. Penguins have it prettyyyyyy rough. 
Should've just learnt to fly


The truest of struggles
There are many apps that can have beer delivered to your home.
"Alexa! Order beer."
You know that's against Reddit tos right? 
r/thalassophobia
Caaaandygram
Landshark who?
Bruce?
Good beer
It's YOUR responsibility to find out which local zoos to support.
Try telling that to a man by the name of Michael Scott.

*Spins* ***and*** *points*
As someone who comes from a British family, even clapping is a bit unreserved for this situation. This would probably warrant an eyebrow raise and muttering "well wasn't that nice?" under your breath.
being happy is like bathing with your siblings, if youre an adult and you still live that way, somethings not right 
I did an air punch jump spin when I hit the $25,000 question on who wants to be a millionaire. I asked the audience and they only gave me 50% and I‚Äôve seen people get it wrong from the audience when it was higher...
Saw a video of a baboon eating a baby antelope alive ass first while the antelope cried out for its mother. Just typing that out brings back a very strong sense of disgust, anger, and a deep, hollow sadness. Because baboons have so many human traits it feels like it should have known better and was just being purposefully callous and cruel. I have no idea if that's true or not, but fuck baboons.
You mean this one?

Oh shit, you just reminded me about that. I think I got gold because I referenced that post before.
I don't know what you're talking about. I've accepted our robot overlord takeover and just get more delivered.
You still have to open the door. There should be an option to have them catapult the beer through my window.

EDIT: Thanks to this comment I now have 69 karma. Please stop upvoting.
We truly live in a golden age
Do they put it in my fridge automatically though?
Or even something worth drinking. ^I ^hate ^beer ^don't ^kill ^me 
Not in my state
What are they gonna do, ban them? 
Like the other comment said, there isn't much reddit can do against it. And I'm entirely fine breaking Reddit's TOS. Even if they had some magic way to ban me (the physical person) for life from a website, I'd be fine never coming back to Reddit. It's just an entertainment.

Not in this case. He's that one that made the claim, so burden of proof is on him. 
No, no, lose the spin
The fuck? I live in Louisiana where we have drive through daquiri joints and liquor stores.

Where are you getting alcohol delivered to your house from?
Paging /r/trebuchetmemes 
Someone I used to know worked at and lived near a brewery, and had a dedicated beer line running in to their house. Talk about convenient. 
If you would instead have them use a trebuchet, they could launch you 90kg of beer from 300 meters away. It's the superior shut in beer delivery medieval siege weapon.
Back to 30 real fast
Shun the non-believer
No.

1. His claim is that many zoos are "bad".

2. This is a commonly known fact.

3. What exactly are you asking to have proven?

4. Again, it is YOUR responsibility to only support good zoos. When you ask obviously stupid questions like "Of all the zoos in the world can you name all the bad ones?", to paraphrase, it really pisses me off.
*does it anyway*
Ontario Canada where we are legally allowed liquor delivery services and have been for years. It's 2018, we can get everything delivered even our groceries.
We can get it delivered here in California. 
did someone say catapult? rubble rubble rubble
This should be a utility available to everyone. Having to go to the store for beer is such a pain in the ass, you can‚Äôt even go when you‚Äôve been drinking.
Non-beerliever
1. We established his claim
2. Not really. The majority of people don't think twice about the facilities that their local zoos provide to the animals. Remember how everyone got up in arms about SeaWorld whenever the Blackfish documentary came out?
3. I'm asking for him to provide some backing to his claim that there are *very few good zoos in the world,* out of however many tens of thousands there might be.
4. I don't care. Get over it. 
I only did it because I nailed the wave.
Why does reddit always have these dumb comment threads on top posts 
I can get my groceries delivered through Amazon Fresh, which has an impressive selection. Can't get beer delivered though, but I have a totalwine next door...
1. You established his claim? How so?

2. Are you fucking serious?  Regardless of who knows it, it's a fact, imbecile.

3. That's what makes you an idiot. You're asking for something that can't be fact checked, instead of making a rational argument.

4. Well that's the important reality of the topic. So if you don't care, why the fuck are you commenting?
Dude, inside jokes occur all the time in threads. I hope to be a part of one someday.
