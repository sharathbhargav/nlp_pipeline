🔥 We did it! In 2 days the /r/NatureIsFuckingLit community has raised $15,685 for charity with 467 donations to the International Anti-Poaching Foundation 🔥🔥🔥

Thank you for helping us reach the goal and for helping these animals!

Everyone who donated, if you have the `Donor` flair your comments will look ***extra special*** in this celebration thread!

(I've turned off the flair for myself because this thread looks crazy if I keep it on.)

(On desktop Reddit where CSS is shown of course, thanks to /u/turikk and /u/Zmodem for help with that.)

If you did donate under your username and didn't get the flair, reply to this and I'll flair you up!

This seems like a fantastic charity, and I'm sorry I'm kind of broke this pay period and was only able to contribute what I was. Wish I could have done more. 
My friend isn’t a reddit user and I got her to donate. Love this community. 
The best people on the internet
How many were saved so far. Can anybody say ? How does this organization work ? 
Well done guys 
Wooooo!!!! 
Ah shit I didn’t see it in time, can I still donate?

Great job everyone, nature is smiling upon you all.
AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME 
You guys are my hero! If I wasn't pennyless I would have helped. Thanks for banding together.
wow, a subreddit that actually contributes something.
And I helped!
Glad we could do it!! Every dollar helps and thanks for taking the time to set this up!!
Yes my dudes!
I hope 100% of it goes to the cause. Not trying to sound cynical. 
i’d like to think that baby rhino’s inner-monologue is just saying “fuck yeah! fuck yeah! oh fuck yeah!” 
Where can I donate?? 
The power of Reddit ⭐️
Great, now what're we gonna do about these asshole teenaged rhinos terrorizing the bird population??

(j/k great job everyone!)
Good stuff folks. 
Thank you. I really hope it’s effective 
You are all good people.
It’s these kind of things that make me realize the good in the silent majority. 
Good job community.

Now, can somebody do something about those pesky birds that are annoying our rhino kiddo?
Wow great job guys! We need more subreddits like this one that try to help the world!
Watching this little Rhino run around have fun makes me feel all warm inside. Having a bad day myself it has all been forgotten watching this little guy. 
Am I still able to donate?
Buuut muhhhhh trofy headddd🦁🦄🐯
Good, rhinos > hooman 
Poachers be licking farts.
I am South African, and even I have not donated, you guys have made me eat humble pie!! Where can I donate??
Kudos!
Not trying to rain on anyone's parade or anything, but is this charity proven to be credible?
Still hard to believe people actually think ground up Rhino horns cure impotency.
Hmmm
Aw I love this subreddit ❤️
Tankboi got the ZOOMIES
Love me some tank puppies 
Amazing!
It’s funny how we all think this is adorable and all that rhino wants to do is trample that bird to death just bc.
That's like half a rhino on this website https://www.discountafricanhunts.com/hunts/hunt-rhinoceros-in-south-africa.html
How important is reoccurring payments to these charities? Does it help plan for long term?
Love you guys 
Donated. Save the animals from jerks!
You raised a quarter of the cost of one rhinoceros horn, way to stop the poachers.
Poach those poachers!!
You guys are too cool! Made a commitment and had it happen, I'll always follow leaders like you!
Why $10 minimum? Accept my chump change damn it!
Great job everyone! 
https://youtu.be/CEOF70v-vek
Great community!  What a great cause!
11k upvotes, 467 donantions. Sad. 
🔥 🔥 🔥 
$15k? Can’t even buy a rhino horn with that.








On the serious though, good for you guys.
This is awesome we need more of this rather than trophy hunting being the only other real option to help curb this stuff
Rhino zoomies... rhoomieeeeees
Wow this is so nice.
Did not donate because no money but I'm super happy for them.
This sub is incredible 
You guys are fucking awesome
r/natureisfuckinglit is fucking lit
Hey r/combinedgifs wanna attach a gif of some stupid fucking poachers being thrown in handcuffs or something at the end of this just for shits and gigs?
thanks to everyone who donated, that’s really amazing!
This is awesome, well done everyone, heck of a job! 
🔥🔥🔥🔥😃 🐙😃 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm sure that will buy a warlord some very nice sex slaves.
All you gotta do is poach the poachers. 
Thoughts and prayers 
Think of the money that could be raised if we put a bounty on the head of every poacher?
Y’all are so awesome! Love to you all from Tx! 
That's an average of $33.50 per person for anyone interested.
On days like these I am just happy that there are so many great people.
grt
Congrats, you raised 1/100000th what hunters contribute annually to preservation. 
That's what happens when you get a great community of people that care about wildlife to band together and make a difference. humanity at it's best!   
Unpopular post coming up !

Okay, now do it again.

And after that, do it again.

In order to make change you have to keep applying change; there can't be one slight movement to complete a long journey.

Start the next fundraiser. And then the next.

And keep hammering on it until you're sick of swinging the hammer, and then hammer some more.

It was a good goal but has done nothing to stop the problem.

Next up... keeping going until the problem no longer exists.
Instead of donating to a foundation that is probably going to use that money to buy tv's and boomboxes  .  How about using that money to hire some Mercenaries to track down and kill poachers in the act of poaching .
Flair me up son 
You are SO flaired! 🔥🔥🔥

Thank you for donating :) 
Mods are lit! 🔥🔥🔥
Flair, table for one please?
Flaired up! Thanks for donating! 🔥🔥🔥
I’ll take some flair please!
Thanks for donating!

Did you donate under your username? It's not showing when I search through the donations.

PM a screenshot of the email you got and I'll get you that flair!

**edit**: Confirmed baybee! 🔥 
Really love seeing what you guys have done with this community. Awesome stuff! 
Hey! Thanks :) 

You should suggest running charity drives to the mods of the subs you run too, it's really easy to set up with Crowdrise!

I donated but didn’t get the flair!
Thank you for donating!

What did you donate under? I'm not seeing your username come up when searching!

PM me a screenshot of the email you got and I'll flair you up!
Congratulations!
Really appreciate the help on the CSS! 

Making donations a more public thing is always helpful to encourage people to give seeing their peers giving as well.

We can use this in the future charity drive threads too!
Hi
I helped the rhinos 🦏
🦏 The rhinos thank you!

You have the Donor flair now, thanks for donating! 🔥🔥🔥
Toss some flair my way.
Done! 

Thanks for donating! 🔥🔥🔥

hey man if you think about it, we is nature too


If you want to learn more about poaching and places where poaching is almost condonable (but not quite), read a book called 🔥 “**The Tiger: A true Story of Vengeance and Survival**.” 🔥 It’s about the far far north east of Russia, where everyone is destitute and the only way to make money is by poaching.

Horrible, right?  I agree.  But the book is worth a read.

Picture a poacher who hunts down an Amur (Siberian) Tiger, out of desperation.  He wounds the Tiger, but makes the mistake of taking the Tiger’s kill.  

The Tiger does not let that go.  She turns and hunts him.  Bits are found everywhere.  People congregate in Maltov’s (he poacher) cabin, but the Tiger circles it, occasionally nodding off, but behaving like a *person* and crouching, all 500lbs or so and 8-9 feet of fatty Tiger.  It leaps 12 feet. The Tiger, like a human, wants *revenge*.

*Inspector Tiger* is a group that protects tigers, but also protects people.  And this Tiger is behaving like a person, so what do they do?  

It’s a great read, I tell you.  You learn a lot about morals and poaching on the poorest parts of Russia.  And why Russia is so poor in that area.
Well done :)
Well the fudraiser is to protect the animals from poachers, so it's people vs people, generally making people neutral.
No, if it wasn’t for people we wouldn’t have to do this. Fuck people. Fuck you and fuck myself.
This is why reddit its the best
Came from /r/all and am piggybacking off tye top comment;

Just wanted to say that I'm happy for you guys for growing as a community and that you've achieved something so great. 
I didn’t even realize we had a drive going on (I don’t frequent this sub often enough). 

When you break it down like that it makes me want to give, because just a generic “donate” always make me feel like “I can’t afford to donate $1000, I won’t really make an impact.” But $30 seems very feasible.
Good job

>$15,685 raised from 467 people donating

That's a lot of money for less than 500 people, impressive!
I didn't know it was on till now. I donated straight away.
Thank you for donating! 

Your username already shows on the donation page :)

You've got the flair now! 🔥🔥🔥
That's awesome! Tell her we appreciate her :)
Here's a good video on them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmo3nt5an_w

They patrol the borders of wildlife reserves and arrest poachers, sometimes converting them into rangers themselves. 

They are armed though, so if the poachers go in shooting these rangers are trained in military techniques to fight back.
Of course! The campaign is here:  

https://www.crowdrise.com/natureisfuckinglit-for-iapf
There's always next time!

We've run three charity drives so far; I'll try to set them up for every 100,000 subscriber milestone but those come fast now!
There's card fees and operating costs that Crowdrise accounts for and asks if the donor would like to factor in before donating and those aren't shown in the final total donations, so I'm pretty sure the $15,805 shown is all going to IAPF.
Right here!

https://www.crowdrise.com/natureisfuckinglit-for-iapf
Anyone can!

Here's a 60 Minutes segment on them:  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmo3nt5an_w

Run by a guy who is dedicating his life to protecting these animals and train impoverished people in the region to value and defend their wildlife.
The sad fact is that poachers sell the rhino horn to Asian medicine practitioners who then mix the ground rhino horn with Viagra, so it does “work”.  The belief that impotence or super “stamina” is perpetuated.  No amount of rational explanation or scientific proof that what is essentially ground fingernails will never EVER (minus the Viagra) give a man the boat he wants/needs-especially after they’ve gotten those “results”.  
ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM 🔥
It does a lot more protecting rhinos than it does to purchase them :)

Yes. Charities definitely appreciate monthly donations. However, any donation is better than no donations. Unrestricted money (which this is), meaning money that isn’t tied to a particular grant or activity, is especially helpful as it allows the organization to plug holes left by project and grant funding from foundations and other institutional donors.
I love you both
Thanks for donating! That's awesome of you :)

I've given you the Donor flair too! 🔥🔥🔥
That's the minimum to cover Crowdrise's operating costs and fees credit card companies charge for transactions, while still benefiting the charity.

Donating $5 or so may actually end up costing them money.

Same thing over on IAPF's website to donate, so there doesn't seem to be a good way to donate under $10.

Maybe save up and just donate in the next drive we do!
I don't see my flair.  Maybe it's turned off?  Can't navigate mobile right now. 
Can't expect everyone to donate, but shaming others for not doing so doesn't help anything.

As we continue our drives, more and more people will contribute and the impact we make will grow!

This is about encouraging people to give to a good cause and showing them why it's worth supporting. 🔥
That's totally fine! It's great to have such a supportive community :)
Nah.
Did you contribute? I'd be happy to give you a flair if so!

Otherwise it comes off a bit rude to be so demanding of other people to give their money, you know?
How about we go ahead and don't suggest doing things that are illegal basically everywhere
Take a minute and learn about the foundation!

They *are* the mercenaries trained to track down poachers and are armed to kill them if need be.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmo3nt5an_w
These kind of organizations are arming and training rangers - the people incredibly dedicated to conservation (putting their lives on the line and working without adequate supplies or even pay sometimes).
Truly impressively 🔥🔥🔥
This community 🔥🔥🔥
Other communties ❄️❄️❄️
dude 4/20 was yesterday and you still lit 🔥🔥🔥
I don't think that's tigers behaving as people. A tiger stalking it's pray systematically sounds like a tiger still. 
Every penny helps.
True, small things done by many people can actually make a difference <3
Almost any charity drive you see will have average donations around that range. Usually lower.
I’m usually pretty broke (college student) so I usually just donate like 5 bucks or something, anything helps
-Ralph Wiggum voice-
So....do you like......stuff?
Fuck yes sealab 2021 reference for the win. 
For Sudan, may he rest in peace
The best part is every charity drive we do it goes up! 

The more people see other people give, the more they feel like giving too. 🔥
It only works out at about $33 per person, so it's not too crazy.
Thanks for donating! 

That's always the trouble, getting people aware of the drives we run. 

Having posts like this certainly gets the word out! :)
Mods are fucking 🔥🔥🔥
Good to know that. Thanks. 
Awesome, Thanks!
Count me in for the next donation round !!
How arrogant to consider yours as the only place to contribute to the APF or any other charity.

I don't want your "flair" - I want you to start the next round, and then the next... or can't you comprehend what you read?

And yes, I've been contributing to anti poaching efforts now for almost 20 years.
To chime in, he is right that it is legal to kill poachers in the countries where IAPF has their efforts concentrated like Mozambique.

They prefer not to kill people, but if the poachers start shooting the IAPF is trained to shoot back.
Its not illegal to kill poachers in some country's.  You just have to go through the right channels .  We could send money to militias that are actively hunting poachers . Buy them some drones and thermal scopes. You're basically just donating your money into a dumpster when you donate to these charities .
I'd only pay for confirmed kills.  We should be holding that money back until they kill a poacher . Donate 1 grand for every dead poacher . 
This is actually cool af dude. Lit.
All communities are  🔥🔥🔥  on this blessed day.
Bantis zōbrie issa se ossȳngnoti lēdys 🔥🔥🔥
I love this mod
This. I've always thought if you could get everyone in a city or state to each donate $1-5, you could put that towards an amazing community related thing.

Edit: and no I dont mean in the form of taxes. We all know the decision making in where to spend them can be flawed and that could happen here I know. Obviously its similar, but it wouldn't be a constant thing. Unless everyone wanted it. Idk how you would go about it but maybe send out a majority poll of what they'd like to see have done in their community and then do that 
I like uhh... nature. It's 🔥🔥🔥
I want to give in the next one 
Your username is 🔥🔥🔥
Wow! So people raise $15,000 for a cause you care about and you decide to drag them rather than appreciate the effort? 
You must understand that commenting "That's not good enough." is not very helpful to anyone at all, right?

We run plenty of charity drives and will continue to, but demanding donations from users is never the way to inspire others to give.


It's always better to convert a poacher into a ranger protecting these animals than to kill them.

Remember, these poachers are doing so because they live in poverty and have to support themselves and their families. Killing a rhino for a horn worth $100,000 is the best way for some to do it.

Teaching them to support themselves by protecting these animals is far better than needless killing.
It’s ice cold bro. Lit.
I love this mod, this sub, and nature. We fuckin lit 🔥 in the least ignorant way and i love it.
Taxes. The word you're thinking of is taxes.
Better keep an eye out then! 

We usually run a charity nomination thread, then a voting thread, then a charity drive thread!

You get Reddit gold for a good nomination! (thanks to Admin /u/internetmallcop <3) 
Thanks! I was kinda surprised it wasn't taken when I changed usernames tbh
bye
Why are you still talking to me? and waffling to boot. What's a matter, initial your initial hubris stopped cold?

Seriously - go back and understand what I wrote.

In spite of the amount raised by this forum "this time", tomorrow, or next week, or next month, or as we 'speak' species will be slaughtered and go extinct at the hand of humans.

Great, you raised what amounts to poverty wages for an American for a year, and for an excellent cause... but slapping yourselves on the asses and saying "well that's it - we're done" is not going to solve anything.

We're pretty much done with this conversation at this point.

Have a great weekend and dream sweet dreams of success.
Yeah and Nazis only killed jews because of orders . The only good Nazi  ( poacher ) is a dead Nazi . With your logic we should take murderers out of prison and turn them into police / soldiers . How about we have drug addicts write drug laws . 
Lmfao I was editing my comment as you replied. See edit 
Is just basic internet research the best way to find good candidates? After learning that even the red cross was misusing funds, I don't know who to trust 
CharityNavigator is a great resource for looking into charities!

https://www.charitynavigator.org/

Also, we can only set up Crowdrise campaigns for US (and Canada I think) registered charities because that's what they've got in the system.

/u/YoSoyUnPayaso nominated a great one in Rewilding Europe, but unfortunately we couldn't set it up with Crowdrise.
There are also some very knowledgeable people around here who can point you in the direction of good groups that are doing great work. Charity navigator is good but not the only way to look at things. What’s your favorite topic or country?
