My shuttle driver in Rome stopped in the middle of the road to save three ducklings who couldn‚Äôt get back to their mother

That shuttle driver is one sharp dressed man. 
My original video with [audible chirping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tgKUAL3jJo)
No more internet for me today, I'm just gonna stop while I'm ahead
At first they look scared. But then that third duck is like "woah bro get me up too."
Great man. ‚ÄúIf not me, then who?‚Äù
r/humansbeingbros
I love the way he just brushes off his hands.
‚ÄúAll done here.‚Äù 
The driver does this so casually like he saves ducklings on a daily basis.
*claps*
I loved that in Rome all the Uber drivers wore suits and were so professional. Maybe they make good money over there doing that idk. I did get scammed though. :( they just sit in there car and don‚Äôt move until you cancel. 
I work at a building with a duck pond and I saw a bunch of ducklings without their mom.  I carried them over to the nearest duck... WOAH!  That duck was not their momma. 
I love how the last duckling runs so fast it falls over
Is anyone else shocked by how fast those chicks can run?
If you watch closely, the third little duckling does an adorable little faceplant on his way back to mum. Everything ducklings do is just too cute.

I love him and the ducks
He'll probably bill them later
Did you tip him?
This is the one occasion where I do not want u/fuckswithducks here
That last duckling fell 
Hero. ü¶Ü 
The third duckling stops running when he realizes his siblings aren't being eaten and just waits his turn for the human elevator.
When in Rome, do as the drivers do.

Tip him.
Can ducks feel grateful? 
Great video until you realize that they usually start out with a lot more then 3 little duckies. 
Some really great camera work at the beginning.

That‚Äôs duckling awesome. 
This man just earned a tip.
You know, they really should put in a duckling access on that street..what is the world coming to
The way they ran towards their mother made me smile! What a gentleman act!
It's not like he was going to be on time anyway.

Give that man a fat tip. 
Pretty sure this guy is already on the Ducks' Reddit now
he had some spare ducks to give
I like how the duck just sits there, what a fucking moron

Dude walked away like a boss!

When in Rome...save the ducks?
Simple acts of caring and love such as this are so wonderful 
Something similar happenned in i believe Quebec last few years on a highway, the lady parked in the middle lane and a vehicle hit it, i believe it killed 4/5 passengers.
I like how he brushes his hands at the end. Job well done.
Yes. 
Been to Rome, curbs are crazy high from the road
Aw man the third chick faceplanted hard. 
Duck feetsies are so cute

Love it!!!
/r/wholesome in a nutshell.
Now how are they ever gonna learn how to climb curbs?!
He's in a suit! Classy.
You got ducks roaming the streets?
I cant see his face but that is a handsome man
Mother ducks can be such dickheads 
I love the fact that ducklings run like ninjas.
Hero.
Momma duck don‚Äôt give a fuck
And they say suits are heartless
#Incredibilis
Always amazes me how fast these little fuckers can run
Reddit is top notch today
‚ÄúCiao‚Äù
I'm surprised they let him catch them so easily.  

I'm reminded of something I once saw in the parking lot of a Target. There were these people who worked for some sort of animal society or animal control trying to round up ducklings that kept running around or underneath their well-marked SUV.  They tried catching them with their hands, they tried using their jackets, but the ducklings kept getting away from them and retreating under the SUV.

I watched them for about 5 minutes before I continued on my way. They didn't catch any ducklings during that time.

It was like 10 ducklings, too.  I don't know what these people and those ducklings were doing in the middle of a Target parking lot.

Anyway, judging by that experience, I figured ducklings are really hard to catch.  But I guess sometimes you get lucky.
Done like a true professional. Clearly this is not his first rodeo.
Inspiring 
‚ÄúWhy did that weird monkey do that for us, mama!?‚Äù
-the ducklings, probably 
God bless you, kind man! 
I love the little Naruto-style run the ducklings make towards their momma :D

This made my day
my mother used to tell me I should‚Äôt touch birds or any animals because then they would have my smell and the parents would reject the young...
"Then a hero comes along"
Curious what would happen without the help of a human.
Eventually would the mother just leave her three kids?... probably nature is ruff boys

My shuttle driver in Rome did a fucking crossword at 85mph while driving in 2 lanes at once.

Last week there was a post about a lady who stopped in the middle of the road to help some ducks cross.  She ended up causing an accident and several people died as a result.  The thread was upset that the woman didn't receive a harsh enough sentence, and only had to spend a few years in jail.

The third one running at light speed to catch up with the others and falling is my life in a nutshell

The way they run back to mama is so cute!!! **TAP TAP TAP TAP *fumble* taP**

So you're shuttle was delayed?
Oooooh DUCKLINGS!

He ended up being struck and killed by a car. Rip.

I need to go to r/politics to get my outrage back.
I was born and raised in Northern Italy and it's hard to explain but we have a lot of compassion and empathy for animals around here - I think more so than in most places in the world.  The generation before our parents had to deal with the war and from that came an emphasis on not taking animals for granted... this is what I was taught by my grandparents anyway back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off h–µll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.
Yes to internet. You are addicted but that‚Äôs okay

I'm from a Med country (poorer than Italy) and Uber drivers dress smart here too. Most of them don't work directly with Uber, but with local travel companies who supply them with cars to drive. Because of this middleman they don't make that much money, but customer expect them to be well dressed. Plus better tip potential and chances to book off the record services is bigger without that much of an effort.
That has happened to me in my home city. Guy just kept driving around in circles and claimed he picked me up.
Uber is illegal in italy now i think
Most of the richest, professional and smartest people that I've met has never seen a suit in their lives.

Did you even read the article you posted?  She parked her car... on a highway.. on the wrong side of the road... causing a crash that killed 2 people.  

Saving the ducks has nothing to do with this story.  The girl is dumb because she was on the wrong side of the road.  She‚Äôs in jail because she caused an accident. 



That accident had nothing to do with wildlife, just a fucking idiot.

> In June 2010, the woman had **_stopped her car in the left-hand lane_** of a provincial highway in Candiac
Are you seriously crying over this or is this just one of those lame, generic comments that always appear when there's something sweet?  Ya know, like some asshole who always says *'who's cutting onions in here'*.  Is that what's going on here? 
That woman stopped in the left lane of a highway where speeds were 60 mph+. There's a difference. 
It's only irresponsible if you don't check the road and other vehicles around you. 
That probable happened there too, if not more severe.
Well it's rude.
That's on a highway, I think the situations may be a bit different.
Okay but she stopped in the left lane on a major high way that‚Äôs a big difference than pulling over on a side street

i think *everybody* has seen a suit at some point in their lives, unless they're living in some ultra rural third world country.
Oh wow. Check Mr hipster nietzsche here. 
Yea fucking right
She ate them, okay?!
I've traveled to countries 4 continents, if tips are not customary what over rules that are American Tourists and American businessman.  They can spot one miles away.  Do they take extra money from Americans... you betcha.  If they don't and you really want to tip them, you have to give it to them as a gift.  Money envelopes and "please accept this gift" helps.
Australia is not a tipping country, but it's still reasonably common to tip a taxi driver, waiter or pizza delivery. It's just not expected, they will take the exact amount and walk away without caring. It's more like your standard normal tip (20%?) is already part of their wage, but you can still choose to give them more than the standard amount. Which is why they will be happy even with small tips.

Tipping is a US custom that allows employers to pay their employees shit while relying on the customers to spend even more to pay said employee.
Its common in canada
Shit, you ever been to Mexico?
But he saved ducklings!
That is BS. It varies a lot between countries, but unknown to Americans, there is more than one country out there.
Although not expected, you usually get better service.
Yeah thought my cabbie was brake checking me everywhere we went

Medium sized country /sarcasm

Yeah it means Mediterranean.
I completely agree that there is absolutely nothing wrong with that statement and that my comment is tangential and definitely not directly relevant. 

I am merely using the comment as a platform to present my view on how there need not be a standardized mechanism to be viewed as smart and professional. Various cultures have their own manifestation of this, hence viewing the world through the same lens..in this case 'a suit', could have it's limitations.
Exactly.
My friend's an engineer, also a manager, he has to show up in suits everyday. They even told him wear nicer suits at some point. They have an image to uphold.
There‚Äôs places and ways to get away with it.  Like some law offices they give no shits as long as you have suits for court, academia is full of terribly dressed people.  Stuff like trades the higher level guys normally have suits for certain meetings and in case of court dates. 
What about, outside of non-urban areas around the world? 

I hope you are not implying that people who live in an 'ultra rural third world country', do not fall under your general definition of 'everybody'.
NO, NOT OK
It's illegal for owners to not compensate workers if their tips don't add up to minimum wage. Most waitstaff makes more than that off tips 
Food and other tipped things are already more expensive outside US..

You don't get anything in tourist areas in Mexico without tipping first. We've [Americans] taught them well.
Mexico is a developing country. Italy isnt 
tipping cannot incentivize people to give better service if the tips are unexpected

[About 17% of the Italian population smokes daily](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Proportion_of_daily_smokers_of_cigarettes_by_level_of_consumption,_2014_\(%25_persons_aged_15_and_over\).png), which from personal experience sounds about right.
wtf you on about, a shit ton of people smokes. Cigs are one of the biggest income sources for the state here.
When I visited Udine and Milan last year it seemed like ever other person I walked by had a lit cigarette in their hand.
Idk where you live/d but that‚Äôs not accurate. While the younger generations smoke *less*, people do smoke a ton still. They even have cigarettes vending machines for when kiosks are closed.
I moved to Hawaii a few years ago from Denver. I would ask people if they minded before I would light up. I never had a person say no. I finally quit asking and just walked far enough to not bother anyone. Less smokers is a good thing for kids
Ha! No, that was just an amusingly appropriate typo.

That's not what I meant. I didn't experience any of those two things. If you go out of the touristy areas, the city is dirty and noisy and ugly.

/r/ofcoursethatsnotathing

FTFY
You didn't have to be so rude.
Ok.

If I can give you some friendly, unsolicited constructive criticism: your comment comes across as extremely self-righteous, judgmental, and preachy.

I think you would have opened up that topic of conversation better by asking the commenter if it was the suit that made him/her think that the driver was professional, and why or why not. Instead you presumed that the commenter thought the driver was professional *because* of the suit and then jumped at the chance to rattle off your cultural views.
I take back my downvote. Here's an updoot. 
I think what OP was saying was that *rich* people don‚Äôt wear suits. You don‚Äôt get rich in academia. You do get rich in the business world (doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc). Business meetings in that world require (at a minimum) collared shirts, slacks and a tie. 

I‚Äôm a lawyer. In office, we need a collared, button down shirt and dress shoes (unripped jeans are acceptable.) In Court, you‚Äôre in a suit with a tie - no exceptions. 
People inside and outside of urban areas wear suits. It‚Äôs the culture of 99% of the professional world. 


Good god get over yourself 
I'M PRETTY FUCKING FAR FROM OK.
That's still sad. They should pay the worker minimum wage and any tips should be on top of their wage.
I‚Äôm using my experience over a decade ago where I was delivering for $3 an hour and getting tips on top of that, whereas my buddy in California at the same time was delivering for $10 an hour on top of tips. Depends on the state and sucks even more if it‚Äôs a small town. Either way tipping is stupid. What I came to realize that middle and lower class tip and upper class don‚Äôt. Which is probably how they came into money. By not spending when they didn‚Äôt have too
Yup. They pay em $3 hr in some states, and we customers have to make up the rest. Its pitiful 
Have you actually traveled outside the US? I didn't find this to be true at all 
Tipping first to get any service sounds more like a bribe instead of the purpose of a tip (namely as an extra for having provided good service for example).
I have never tipped in advance of service in Mexico
Tip em at the beginning.
No you both

Oh ok. I guess we just have different views on it all
Now that's exactly what a bot would say /s
I like that name... see mine? 
Space is pretty neat.
Good bot.
Bad Bot
YOU GODDAMN TRAITOR!
Excuse me sir but you could have named yourself "Explorer1_ Steve"
Haha!
Username checks out.
He‚Äôs just having a laugh 
Ok, I take your point. 
I suspect that we have different definitions for the word 'professional world'. 
For instance I'm extending my definition to professionals ( doctors, engineers, architects, designers, bankers, consultants, teachers etc) who work in small cities,towns and villages across the globe. 
By my definition, '99%' is a massive overstatement.

I can only urge you to expand your horizon, otherwise we can agree to disagree. 
In some states, including California, the pay is min + tips. 
No, it‚Äôs really not sad, in my personal opinion. Or, at least, I‚Äôve never had any grievances with it, personally. 

I‚Äôm a server. I make way more than minimum wage because of my tips. I agree that, on the occasional slow day, when tips are obviously going to be less, restaurants should at least bump our wage up to bring us to minimum wage for that day. However, usually they don‚Äôt because, on most other days, we are making far above minimum wage and it usually all evens itself out by the end of the pay period.

It always seems to be that, when I get a bad tipper, someone else will come along and tip way above 20% and that little extra makes up for the person before that was a bad tipper and so, by the end of my pay period, I‚Äôm still far above minimum wage. Serving is a shitty job to some people. Personally, I actually really enjoy it. Maybe I‚Äôm one of the few people to say that. But, I get to walk around all day, stay active, I am not restricted to my desk, my job basically revolves around chatting with people all day, which I love to do anyway, I take home a crap-ton of cash every single day, and how much I earn depends on me. If I want to buy myself something that I normally wouldn‚Äôt buy, I pick up an extra shift or two and I get to buy said thing, while also never dipping into my bill funds. I don‚Äôt find it to be ‚Äúsad‚Äù. I actually enjoy it. 
It's not sad. Our custom allows us to make _significantly_ more than if it were just a "livable wage" and whatever people felt like adding if they even did all the while allowing these establishments to have plenty of staff on-hand for super prompt service.

These arguments are almost _never_ from people that work in the industry, just people that can't do math.

Enjoy the price of your dinner going up 3 fold.

Yup. I grew up poor and I tip well because I know ppl helping me depend on it. But it's not needed. We as a society just need employers to pay a fair wage (just like the rest of the industrialized countries).

If they cant afford it (wages are usually a small fraction of costs), then close up shop buddy. Youre bad at business 
Upper class people tip all the time what do you mean
I like to think of it as interesting, but if I dwell on it, all I'm left with is this hollow feeling.... of like, emptiness.

Hell yeah space!
The only people who like tipping g culture are people who get tipped, because they know they make way more money than they should. 
It usually works out best for waiters at a sit down restaurant, however delivery drivers get the short end of the stick. Tips aren't great for drivers if you aren't in a great neighborhood. Then tack on gas and maintenance and you get really fucked.
It's more that the general stigma around tipping ends up being an awkward situation for the customer. I've worked back and front of house in a tipping environment and it goes without saying that it's great if you work in a busy, mid-high range restaurant. 

It's that it shouldn't be necessary or commonplace for people to tip 10-20% on a meal.
I used to be a restaurant host, which didn't pay much but was otherwise an awesome job. Like servers, smart managers realize that when you're happy, customers are happy too.

It's funny though, in almost all jobs, some people are happy and some people are miserable. Like, it doesn't matter what you do, it's how you handle it.
You earn more than you deserve and as a result are okay propping up a system that treats customers like shit.
I used to be a server at a shady restaurant and I did not get fairly compensated. That is to say, I made, on average, below minimum wage. This law allows shady owners to get away with shady shit far more easily. It sucked. If you're working for a decent ownerthen I guess it's not bad. 
Waiters already make a shit ton compared to chefs. 
Actually from what ive heard theres a kinda hierarchy in the service industry. If your a waitress and you want your host to seat the customers to your liking, you have to break them off a %. If you want the chef to make the food in a timely manner, or put your orders on a higher priority, you have to break them off a %. You want the busboy to clean your tables fast and clean? You have to break them off a %. Same common sense in the dancing industry. You want the dj to play your songs right and call/hype you up in peak hours? Break bread. You want the bouncer's one set of eyes that are responsible for all the ladies in the room to favor you? Break bread. Of course you don't have to, but the operation goes a lot more smoothly when the gears are greased. Also the waiters/dancers are the most expendable when compared to chef/dj. If you complain to higher ups its their word over yours.
Most other countries seems to handle it just fine without costing 3 fold more.
3 fold? Not even close. The price increase is minimal.

A restaurant in my town just got rid of tips and raised menu prices.  It was like a 4 dollar difference or something for meals.  Like from 12 to 16.  I don't think drink prices changed much.
It won't be that  just prices would go up. If such economic reforms are properly implemented, then you will also be earning enough to afford such services. 
Or the expected tip can go from 20% to 5 or less 
Unfortunately, we live in a society of bad business owners and penny pinchers.
Well, based on my fun research of 4 years delivering and co workers/friends who also delivered, this is not the case. But you know better than me.
As opposed to a hollow feeling of fullness?
Numale alert
Space best place.
