choosing optimal cluster
elbow
silhoutte



generative
discriminative classifier model



evaluating clusters
f score cluster evaluation  -- need to be tagged i.e u shd know the actual number of clusters in data -- 500 odd docs

Presentation-----suppose different news in business and some other tech where two parties go and sign agreement to buy something-  word2vec sees context as saame and clusters them both into single cluster although they are of different industries







intro:
tfidf,jaccard lsa eucl etc full math
word2vec full math

high level cluster ,classifier
choosing optimal,sillhoutt score , elbow method


Cluster evaluation -- fscore

application:

limitations-soft clustering vs hard clustering , kmeans drawbacks complexity(doesnt work for large data) -convergence won't happen, very slow on
next steps -
