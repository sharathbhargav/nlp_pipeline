Yahoo not even using their own search engine

"I'm not getting paid enough for this shit." someone thought
Yahoo search is just Bing anyway, which makes it even funnier
Using their own search engine makes the tweet far less relatable to the target audience of Yahoo Sports NBA. If the Sports team is incentivized to create a successful social media presence for itself and not for its parent co's search engine, who can blame them for using the better search engine?
I’ve always thought Yahoo! does fantasy sports really well. Other than that, it might as well be Altavista for all of its relevance.
Yahoo Sports NBA tweeter getting huge shit at the office today
Lol it’s pretty funny to be honest 
Look at that guy. He’s got his Sabre phone on, and he’s not even using it.  

This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog. 
Ya-who?
That's because their engine sucks.
Yahoo can fuck itself
What is that nylon hat that lebron is wearing? Seems like the only time I’ve seen it is the black guy from curb
Duckduckgo is my favourite 
My Yahoo email was hacked and I stopped using them ever since. 
This meme is stolen, anyways.
I remember them retiring their search engine a while back.
Wait, Yahoo is still around?
Yahoo has a search engine? 
He might need to chill on the gym for a while. Starting to look like a cartoon. 
Theyre not a search engine company, they're email
Yahoo realised that they lost a few years ago and stopped developing their search engine - it is powered by Bing. They wanted to focus on Yahoo News, Mail, Tumblr, Flickr, Yahoo answers etc.
Bing is Microsoft, isn't it? I thought Yahoo had their own search engine.

EDIT: Huh, fair enough. [Bing powers Yahoo Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Search).
And I'm pretty sure their search engine stopped being a focal point of their business model a long time ago anyway.
Finance is actually pretty good as well. 
Yeah, their fantasy football is my favourite by a mile. I also really like(d?) their games. I played a shit ton of euchre, crib, pool and poker on there.
Yahoo finance is probably the best one out there that is free
My friends and I would Altavista to look at naked women on the school computers in like 2002
As a white guy who has seen the wire I can without a doubt say that Doorags are put on to give them waves in their hair somehow. 
The only people who use DuckDuckGo are the privacy conspiracy theorists. The search engine sucks
7th most visited website on the internet.
Well I hope they don't go anywhere soon, I have 21,312 unread emails to go through.
Nope.
> They wanted to focus on Yahoo News, Mail, Tumblr, Flickr, Yahoo answers etc.

Wow that's a who's who of things nobody cares about.
Interestingly, it was announced yesterday that [Flickr was bought by Smugsmug](https://www.smugmug.com/together/).

And also, from the [Yahoo! Search wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Search), Bing is its own competitor:
> As of February 2015 [Yahoo! Search] is the third largest search engine in the US by the query volume at 12.8%, after its competitors Google at 64.5% and **Bing at 19.8%**.

They also seem to have [some sort of agreement with Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Search#Search_technology_acquisition):
> In October 2015, Yahoo subsequently reached an agreement with Google to provide services to Yahoo Search through the end of 2018, including advertising, search, and image search services.

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
I know for sure their fantasy sports division is doing great
Yahoo and Bing actually sort of share traffic. 

Yahoo does have their own search engine called Yahoo! Gemini. But coming from someone who works in the paid search advertise industry, it's fucking awful. 
flickr sounds like a lesbian dating site.
Yahoo hasn't had their own in a while.  They used Google for a while, then went their own way for a bit, but they gave up in 2009
Oh man, I just realized Bing stands for Bing Is Not Google.
[deleted]
I would love to know what's Yahoo's business anyway
I would hope so.
I’ve noticed yahoo finance has been boggled down by click bait ads and flashing gifs, making pages slower to load and harder to scroll.  Such a shame that they manage to even kill that part of their site. 
Yahoo Pool. So many hours spent on that. I still sucked though haha
gotta get the waves on swim
But reddit circlejerk
Haha, I have no idea how many I have... 21 years I've had that email address
Tumblr is big, and for some reason people still use Yahoo mail.
Yahoo has good financing info so that's exciting 
Tumblr is surprisingly still going strong and I still use my first ever Yahoo email since it's [lastnamefirstname]@yahoo.com
Flickr actually just got bought by Smugmug.
They have a decent fantasy football app.
Yet they are still more appealing than Yahoo search.
At this point, I'd say their video streaming platform is their best product. I remember when the NFL a few years ago was shopping around for streaming services besides their own and Yahoo was one of them, and it was flawless.

Meanwhile, ESPN is pretty synonymous with "buffering"
Yahoo Sports and Yahoo Finance are pretty useful
Yahoo News/Sports is actually pretty decent. They typically do second-hand reporting, but they do a good job sourcing the claims in an article and are somewhat earlier to give comprehensive analysis than many other sources. 

They aren't the best, but especially their sports news is not as bad as one may think.
Flickr is dope
I used Yahoo mail for almost 15 years. I took two massive security breaches for me quit.
Yahoo finance is pretty big in beginning finance classes (at least in my area)
Yahoo business is still used
Yahoo news draws 175 million monthly unique viewers so I'd say it's working alright 
Didn't know that re. Flickr. 

I was just saying their search is "powered by" Bing's search engine, but Yahoo would still have some market share if people are still using it. They aren't developing their own search engine anymore though. 

I think at one point they even used Google results, but I guess they're currently just partnered with Google for ads - Google AdWords have a partner network option, which includes third party sites.
Remember when they were powerful 
Yahoo is killing the game on their fantasy sports platform. Best out there imo.
What's really great is that they could've bought Google for 1M in 1998. 
Does it really? That's silly. Recursive acronyms are the worst!!
Why is it called Bing?

Because It’s Not Google. 
No it doesn't.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Japan

News, auctions, other stuff. 

It's not all about the USA. I'm sure it's a popular website in other countries as well. It felt so wrong whenever my Japanese coworkers would open yahoo instead of google in front of me but yahoo is still going strong abroad even if it's lost the battle for best search engine in the US 
Historians maintain the answer was lost long ago.
I prefer their fantasy sports platform, so there's that I guess
They're an Alibaba share tracker. A previous CEO made a wise/lucky investment in them some years ago. Nothing else they do really has any effect.
Fantasy Sports!
Can confirm, gf uses it. Do not understand.
I use it because an account I had before google even started. I don’t use it for important stuff tho 
Because they started using it back when Yahoo was bigger than Google, not that I would know anything about that.
Only thing I have a yahoo address for is Flickr, and they just got sold off so that's not going to be a limiting factor much longer.
I still use my Yahoo mail I made over 10 years ago, for things that aren't private like signing up for forums/websites or just about anything else that needs email verification. 
Let's be real though the only development they've done on tumblr in the last two years was for ads
I use tumblr purely for porn.
Tumblr could be great, but the website and app get more and more broken every year and they never fix anything 
Yahoo finance is by far the best site to follow stocks and news. 
Member that jingle?

"YahoooooOoooooOooooOooooooooooo" 
According to the Alexa ranking, it's the 7th largest website one the world, just behind Reddit.
I member
My main email is still @yahoo.com, I just can't give it up. 21 years now.
Remember when they made DVD players?
I remember back in school they always tried to get us to do research with Yahooligans the “kid friendly” yahoo search engine, but it was literally the worst and you couldn’t find anything nearly relevant on there
Remember when Google was BackRub? 
Yahoo Sports (and Fantasy) and Yahoo Finance are great
But if they bought it, it wouldn't be the Google it is today
Please help, it won't stop
aight fixed

yeah but Yahoo (a division under Verizon's Oath company) doesn't even own Yahoo Japan anymore. I think they just live because old people still comment on the news articles and Tumblr is still popular
They have one of the largest news distribution platforms on the internet.

YOU NEVER UNDERSTAND! 
Why not?

Sure there are other services available, but not everybody wants to use Gmail.
It's a 20-year old email so I have countless things associated with it already. So it's to this date still my 'sign up for new shit' email (and also my 'relatives' email), even if it isn't my professional email or my with-friends email.
I use it for signing up to things I am 99% sure will spam me with shit. 
She pretends to use Yahoo so you wont see the GMail she messages other men on. 
My gf also uses it, is it weird that that is a turn off?

Exactly! It’s adblock compatible and really easy to navigate and find all the information that you need, plus it has crypto currency prices listed too

Member da eighties?
haha I understand, my main is Hotmail, has been for almost 20 years 
Absolutely agree with finance too.
:)
Dude, Yahoo! Sports is surprisingly common, and they do have a decent reporting staff and a very small set of journalists. They occasionally are the primary source for a piece of news coverage, it's rare, but I have seen it. 

Their sports coverage is supposed to be pretty good though. 
Yeah, Let's try not to go all Facebook on our email clients.
Fair point. But this is why people don't use [Yahoo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches)
I have a few million good reasons why not

https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/yahoo-hack-details-personal-information-was-i-compromised-affected-leak-a7981671.html
My family uses Yahoo mail and resetting the password if you forget it is near impossible. With Gmail you can always gain access some how.
That's why I still use my Hotmail. It's an ancient address, and that's fine. I mostly use it to sign up for stuff. I have other email addresses for other purposes, whether professional, personal, or whatever, which I prefer not to use for signups.

Don't know why people think it's weird that 'unfashionable' email services are still used. They're a tool, nothing more. If the tool still works as intended, why not use it?
Interesting case! I'm glad it was settled amicably
Lol, you plebs. Road Runner master race. 
Hotmail?  I've still got my @msn.com address and all its grandfathered baggage.
oh yeah i forgot Sports... weird since I'm commenting on a picture about Yahoo Sports
I used yahoo until I tried to reset my password and screwed it up somehow to where I have no idea what the password is. Was frustrated enough to move to gmail, but every now and then I've tried to get back into the old email without success.

Ok, fair enough. I thought it was more about not wanting to use Yahoo because if it isn't the latest trendiest thing it obviously can't be usable, which I think also happens a fair bit.
Yeah but that shit happens everywhere.  Practice good password management and it really isn't a bother.  

I mean just look at your account.  You've posted IMGUR links in the past, yet they've had their fair share of data breaches as well.
Not me, I wanted a war
hahahaha This made me laugh

"You don't know the burden of an MSN account like I do"

I totally understand not wanting to go to the Outlook callsign
My father still has Yahoo! set as his homepage for this very reason haha

I get to remember every time I see him and he asks for some computer help!
good bot

I mean my gmail account hasn't leaked so far I'm pretty sure.
It doesn't actually happen everywhere. Yahoo is notorious now for their several huge email database leaks. Not really comparable to other modern email providers.
 People don't typically post sensitive personal/financial information on sites like imgur so less people care.
Yeah but imgur doesn't have any of my data. 
*You merely adopted MSN...*
Gmail data has [absolutely been stolen before](https://thehackernews.com/2017/03/gmail-yahoo-password-hack.html). Techspot lists gmail as having the [third largest](https://www.techspot.com/news/71843-google-data-breaches-responsible-most-stolen-credentials-but.html) number of people who've had their data breached, exceeded only by Hotmail and Yahoo.
