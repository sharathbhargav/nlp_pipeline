Taking one for the team

Quick, somebody NewpaperGold! that guy!
Bless your empathy for our plight in the US! The majority appreciates it! ❤️❤️❤️ Much love to our Norwegian brothers and sisters!!!
I can imagine the US response," oh no, the President is gone, well we looked under the bed, guess he quit"
Not all hero's wear capes.
They can be rescued after a few days because Trump will probably die from Twitter withdrawal.
If he really did it perhaps we could give him the Noble Peace Prize.
The hero we need
Might not be a bad experience.  By many accounts, Trump is just a social chameleon who gives you what you want so that you'll like him.  As long as you find something else for him to sexually assault, he might make a pretty good island-mate.
Bring your pepper spray.
Best human. 
Having your own personal clown on this stranded island doesn't sound too bad.

Just make sure Trump comes with a mute button...
Two men enter only one man leaves.
Pepper spray isn't going to do shit, he built an immunity, that's why is face is orange. Bump him in the shin. 
Quiet Mike Pence doesn't mean he changed...
Good guy Norwegian!
How much edible meat could you get from trump?
But the question is, can he still tweet from that island??
What that say?
The rest of the world needs to mind their own fucking business. Why do you spend so much time thinking about a country you don’t live in? I don’t waste time thinking of the EU 
Well, we literally border Russia, and with the draft and everything I and most others under 40 are likely to die, so it would be quite stupid of us to ignore your Class A tropical shitstorm of a political scene. 
<3 
Well not just in the US. His idiocracy has a global effect. East Asian power shift for example.
«So sad. Bring me Heretic List, Mother. The bonfire of the vanities begins this evening.»
...but, many wear crepes.
Heroes.
All heroes wear woolen hats and skis. 
Move over Jesus, there is new savior of mankind
Is that intentional?
Lol.  I have noticed lately that he has increased from a few tweets a day to almost 10 plus now.  It's getting crazier and crazier.
But don't deserve..
I'd rather have someone who was somehow able to contribute to surviving there.
Agreed, it'd probably be an enjoyable experience (all things considered). Plus, you'd be more likely to be rescued.
Well, if it's a tropical island, I'm sure there are plenty of coconuts.
And rape whistle, oh wait.
Feed Trump to the restless natives.
Kneeling and praying for the fortitude to battle his demons, known as 'The Gays'.
It's written in english in the image.

I think the world would be a better place if we all thought about our international friends more often.
How big is that rock you're living under? 2, 3 bedrooms?
So you're saying it's wrong for people outside of the US to worry about the largest military power in the world being run by a toddler cosplaying as the brightest cheese in the dairy section?
Norway is not in the EU. Go back to school, cuck. 
we are all world citizens on this blessed day.
So...because you're selfish the rest of the world should be too? I'm not sure that's a great strategy friend. It's actually beneficial to think outside yourself. :)
Do bone spurs disqualify you from the draft in Norway?
Smart brukernavn. 
*hiros
How do your wear skis?
Yes
The walls, they’re closing in.
After forty years of Republicans and center-right Dems wreaking the country, we do deserve a break.
He might be edible...
Well, you can always eat him if the going gets tough. He is quite well marbled. 
When the chopper shows up:

"You guys just missed him! He built a boat and started sailing that way.  Come on! Let's go look for him! No, he's not on the island anymore, so don't bother looking for him. Let's go!"
oh... lol... sorry((( missed this )))))))
Yeh but wut that say?
No, we need to let people live their lives and have their own societies.

Yes, it would disqualify you from a lot of roles in the military, and thus those with bone spurs or arm problems are often exempted unless there is a real need for them. 
Hah, takker! Kaizer-fan du også? 
Gyros
Like shoes. 
Ah ok that was bugging me.
The Jews made you miss that? Er...
You should build a wall around your trailer.
Good bot. 
Well then our tropical shitstorm hasn't been a complete loss for you, now you know how to avoid the draft.  You can live out your days in a Russian paradise, maybe even become a puppet Prime Minister!
um there is **always** a need for paper pushers...... sit the "bone spurs **victim** at a damn desk since they cannot walk and stick a pencil and piece of paper in their hand......
Nei, men en kamerat av meg er den verste Kaizer-fanboyen. 
Kebab
Sorry, too late for me, was already drafted some years ago. Unless I somehow grow a bone spur in the meantime, that means I will get redrafted in case of war. 
Yeah, but we have old officers for that, and we only need so many spurry bois to help them out. 
Haha forståelig, skulle jeg til å si uten noe partiskhet så klart! De har jo en helt egen stil for seg selv, så jeg kan lett skjønne at man enten elsker de eller ikke liker de i det hele tatt. 
Kabob
Eh, de er okay, jeg har bare forskjellig musikksmak.
