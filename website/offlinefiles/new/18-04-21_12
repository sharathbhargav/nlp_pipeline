lmao!

but seriously, how did he shoot flames out his butt?
Lloyd's fantasy 
Did that just burn that guys eyebrows?
How does one learn this power?
That could've really...backfired
Dude got flame-farted on and starts laughing?  Wtf?
That man eats too much taco bell.
I am... intrigued. 
There's medicine for that. 
How do you learn how to do this?
This is from canadian magician Vincent C. [Here is his Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/vincentCmagicien/featured)
Its a french-canadian called Vincent C. And he is a magician

10/10 for the painting of the handgun on the wall.
I too need a flamethrower anus
haha. that girl’s face. disgusted yet amused. 
It's all fun and games until the house catches fire 🔥
Me irl when I eat the Doritos locos taco from Taco Bell. 
But where did the lighter fluid come from?
Why is this not an Olympic sport
Why was I focused more on the framed picture of a large hand gun on the wall?
I knew this would happen !! I was a genius when i was 8 years old !
More like r/bloodmagicfuckery
Fire goes in, fire goes out. Can't explain that.
Well I know for sure what ONE of my three wishes would be.
Alright, now I have an excuse to learn that flame swallow shit
Inhuman found
any one else notice the wall art from kickass?
I love that song
Reminds me of the south park movie where Cartman bet kenny $100 dollars ,he can't light a fart on fire 
I like how the dude on the right seems totally unconvinced until he catches hot gas straight to the eyes.
Every action has a reaction

Is this a good hair removing method?
So then he says “Do you love me?” And she says “No, but that’s a real nice ski mask!”
dudebro
I the king of the drawing dub thee as Sir.buttflamer 😎😎😎😂😂😂
I meant dragons
Just like the tide, you can't explain that!
He gets all the chicks

*jealous*
"So he says do ya love me"? And she says "no, but that's a real nice ski mask"!
It's all fun and games until Jenny loses an eyebrow.

Then it's hilarious.
He said “do you love me?” I said “ no, but that’s a real nice ski mask”
While a cool trick have to question if aiming directly at your audience is a good idea
He pulled that trick out his ass 
Yeah I thought hmm well he would have to shoot flames out of his buttocks to make this title even reasonably true. Didn’t think it was possible but the title certainly delivered.
I feel like this is every dad’s dream joke.
He's using a device called the Pyro Mini Fireshooter, which is concealed within his wrist and uses flash paper. 
Visual representation of what I am going through as I type this comment from the bathroom after eating the spiciest ribs I’ve ever had last night. 
Does it smell like a fart or fire?

cool repost.  then again, what isnt a repost these days.
what I wonder if that is a real Andy Warhol print back there, he could have burnt it and he would be in debt for life
Now I believe in magic

That was funny.
If you don't yell "that's a spicy meatball!" Then you didn't do the 90's right.
Holding the device in his left hand. More a camera angle trick.

OMG LIKE LITERALLY!! LOL LMFAO ROTFL
I can do that just by eating taco bell
Michael Scott’s condo?
HOLY SHIT
This needs sound.
You can’t explain that
Link to the actual video..?!
I’d be scared to stand in line behind this guy especially after he’s had a truckload of chilli for dinner. 
That might be the funniest thing I've ever seen on reddit.
This is me after chipotle 😂
Im calling fake.  First when you light a fart they do not shoot like that. Peraonal experience.  Secondly no one jumps back.  That fireball shot straight at all those guys and not one jumps back.  Reaction was prerecorded and the fire ball added as a post effect.
It is a repost
You replied to a bot. If it is a repost then just downvote this post and move on
It’s not replying to a bot, I’m letting people know that this has been reposted a huge amount of times.
/r/SavageVoodooBot is a bot. You replied to them.
You're a bot 
No u
No you both
No actually posting on a bot sticky is brilliant. It's the only place where you're not hijacking a top comment so he won't get downvoted, and also everyone sees this sticky so it's perfect. Even if not everyone sees the replies, more people will see his comment here than anywhere else
You really are hopelessly lost.
Wow, original
/r/thisismylifenow
Needs sound to be appropriate. Ban gifs. 
My guess is that the stick itself has a tiny little Flair inside that he presses with his thumb after making a show of trying to break wind.
I think he is using [this thing](https://www.ellusionist.com/pyro-mini-fireshooter.html). Could be wrong, but that seems like the most logical way. If you can see the wand he’s holding it isn’t angled correctly to shoot from there. 

That’s my guess. 
I’m wondering the same thing! It may have something to do with the stick.  As he gets into the farting position - you could see him subtlety twirling the hot end of the stick. 
So someone's already mentioned the candle in the pic, but I just spent about half an hour googling 'lighting your farts on fire" and this is my humble TIL

>Fart lighting, also known as pyroflatulence or flatus ignition, is the practice of igniting the gases produced by human flatulence, often producing a flame of a blue hue, hence the act being known colloquially as a "blue angel", "blue dart", or in Australia, a "blue flame"

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fart_lighting
>but seriously, how did he shoot flames out his butt?

[Check out](https://i.imgur.com/K5RPPqC_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium) the size of the fart bullet!
little gadget that goes on your wrist it throws thing tissue that lights up. same thing that causes flame to pop out of nowhere and magician reaches out for a card.
I imagine it's a pyro mini fireshooter or something similar.

[pyro mini](https://images.vat19.com/covers/large/pyro-mini-fireshooter.jpg)
I have one of these. It is on his right wrist.
the video is in reverse
Methane in the fart gets ignited by the still hot stick?
Can't everyone just do that?
A little fairy lives there to shoot those yellow flames.
Chipotle
Flash cotton and flash paper, it's just a little tube with a glow plug in one end
he had a second stick in place
Theres a candle infont of his ass
I’m a simple man. I see a Dumb & Dumber reference. I upvote.  
No, but that’s a real nice ski mask!
He should of thrown a bowl of peanuts in his face after the stunt 
Lloyd's fantasy come to life! Only not as sexy.
Not from a Jedi.
The dark side of the ass is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be...unnatural.
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Gaseous The Flatulent? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a fart legend. Darth Gaseous was a Dark Lord of the Fart, so powerful and so flatulent he could use his farts to influence his lower intestine to create fire… He had such a knowledge of flatulence that he could even keep the ones he cared about from farting. The the large intestine is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was having diarrhea, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice fed him Chipotle in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from intestinal distress, but not himself.

There it is
I'm sure there's lots of tutorials on Youtube.
Thanks, you the real MVP. 
Or somebody’s face.
...yet.  
Because it's the brightest thing in the frame and it's in a focal point. 

Or you just like pink stuff 🤔
Lol no
You got downvoted to hell, but you’re right.
It's either that or this morning's pork vindaloo.
Hey man maybe this is real magic for once. Can't we give real magic a chance?
Definitely this. If you watch he turns the wand around, tip to audience, and then holds it against his side. It is away from camera, but that is most likely how this is done. Well spotted.
He has a stick up his ass?
I was thinking flash paper 
The way he's holding the stick doesn't look right for that, but either way it's damn impressive.
Yea he clearly positions the stick before bending over. Still very impressive xd
You know, the Nazis had pieces of flair that they made the Jews wear.
Oh man do I want one of those 
Wow.  $150 for a fart joke.  That's some dedication. 
Gah I want it but I know I'd burn my house down.
How do you install that in your ass though?
But where did the lighter fluid come from?
Name checks out
Good thing he didn't blow his wad too early. 
Well there goes $150 out of my bank account...
thats what i thought too

Buying this 
I think that's what people said the last time this was posted.
that candle is too far away to light a fart. the flame has to be pretty close. the gas dissipates really quickly when it leaves your butt.

If this was the case then this man has a blue angel like never seen before. 
Aspen. Ahh, California.

Ironic.

Because it's weird, tacky, and makes me wonder who puts that in their wall, maybe a gun nut.
Because everyone already knows it's fake lol
People think its so great they will sacrifice the truth to believe in a lie.
Nothing about cgi altered videos is blackmagicfuckery.  If one of the few that down voted me has an explanation even remotely plausible im listening.
Fucking delicious. 
Smeg head
It saddens me that most Americans haven't had true vindaloo, it's vinegary and delicious. Find a real Goan restaurant (not a North Indian or South Indian one) -- there's one in the Bay Area, and try some Goan dishes: vindaloo, sorpotel, xacutti... You'll be a believer for life. Godspeed! 
Poo in the loo
I thought Indians don’t eat pork?  Pork vindaloo sounds amazing.  What other illegal foods can we think of?!
Or a McDonald's breakfast burrito. Two of those and your neighbors will think there's a gas leak.
Either that or he's a fucking pyromancer
I'm all for it!
South park is the one that gets magic right
Could be. Definitely burns like flash paper. The speed and direction made me thing its a little flare. Maybe the stick is a spring loaded cylinder that pushs flash paper out?
But where did the lighter fluid come from?
Yes you do 
Well, it can be all your for Hundred-fifty 
Resist the inner neck beard.
I don't know do you?
Yep this looks super cool but I know I'm absolutely not experienced enough to safely use it
but $150 is nothing more than 150 pennies.

also is your username an orgy reference

Hey, CommonMisspellingBot, **by** is a preposition which requires a subsequent noun phrase. So **You can remember it by should have...** isn't correct.

Well that was a *blast* to the past.
Band name?
Worth
I understood that reference
Have had North, South, and Goan food. Goan is not my cup of tea. It was *okay* and but not something I enjoy eating. Everyone's tastes are different. I don't like the vinegary taste, just as I don't like the sweet taste of American Chinese dishes.
Fuck off. That restaurant has nothing to do with this post.
I live in the Bay Area, what is the name of this awesome restaurant? 
Most white people can't handle spices. I know people who think black pepper is too hot. 
Man I did not understand any of that...
> What other illegal foods can we think of?!

One of my friends used to always order a veggie burger with bacon at restaurants. He just liked the taste of the veggie burger more than beef.

He always got weird looks from the waitstaff. Sometimes they'd say "oh, we don't have veggie bacon" and he'd say "yeah regular bacon is fine".
Depends on the Indian. But many Hindus eat pork but not beef.
Vindaloo is originally a Portuguese dish which uses pork. 
ODed on Chipotle prior to the performance.
Yeah that’s true that’s always an option that we should keep on the table 
The video implies you can somehow charge it to make more fire. So who knows.
Lighter fluid can't melt steel beams
Like Uncle Trevor uses!
I've made a huge mistake. 
It's flash paper not lighter fluid according to the blurb:

>Pyro's secret is that the barrels are filled with 'flash' paper. A specially-treated tissue paper that burns extremely quickly and is gone in the blink of an eye. Magicians have used flash paper in their acts for decades to get huge reactions from a tiny burst of fire.

It's [Viva Goa](https://www.yelp.com/biz/viva-goa-san-francisco), sorry didn't wanna mention the name earlier for fear of people thinking it was a plug. I have no affiliation with the place, but I always make it a point to visit if I'm in the neighborhood. Owner is friendly and speaks Konkani, my native tongue, so it feels like home, even when I'm halfway around the world :)
Racial Stereotype... thanks for that... have a down vote
I’m white(Canadian) and in the Bay Area. I would half agree on this one. Although the funniest is back in the Midwest. The spice aisle in the local grocery consisted of salt ,pepper and a couple others. 
Everything else was in the ‘ethnic’ section😂
Somewhat true, especially of older generations. My gf is white, and I've been training her in the spicy arts; she comes from a very bland background, and we have curry at least thrice a week. She can put me to shame sometimes on spice levels, and can even make a mean Indian curry, haha! So lucky to have her
Hehehe, it's okay. Something to try the next time you're feeling adventurous. Suffice it to say that most Indian restaurants are making their own interpretation of vindaloo, and not the real thing.
That does actually sound pretty good.  I like the texture of veggie burgers 
Some of the places around here call that a "dirty vegan".
The reverse is also equally common
Vindaloo is *based* on a Portuguese dish, but uses palm vinegar instead of red wine.

Or so wikipedia tells me.
They demonstrated one on Channel Super Fun. It burns rolled up cylinders of paper. There are two holes in the end and you have to refill them with paper after each use. 
His/her/therms comment was an Arrested Development reference 
But why male models?
Maybe the beams were never steel in the first place.
They were quoting Arrested Development, not actually asking a question. 
I'm 90% sure that's a magicians joke, probably about a prop penny costing $1

Can’t wait to cash them in. Saving up to say something really offensive 
No prob, you were definitely just trying to be helpful and I just wanted to give you a heads up that he probably wasn't going to thank you for clarifying how it worked. 
Reddit has progressed to the point where it doesn't automatically understand Arrested Development references, I'm getting old.

I would recommend going for 2 more subtle offensives things. Way more milage for your money when the receiving party is only 70% sure they heard you say what they think you said and can't decide if they can act offended or not.
Never thought I’d see the day.
