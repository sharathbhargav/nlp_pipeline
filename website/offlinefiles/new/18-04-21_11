A hand-made retrofuturistic digital clock.

Ok, but are we in the 1% divergence?

Fake nixi tubes?
Is it in the alpha world line?
 ** Mandatory El Psy congroo **
:thinking:


I love this thread
I opened this thread expecting Steins;Gate comments...not disappointed.
It's clearly an organization trap to collect all S;G fans at one place and silence them because we know too much.
Amazing, a world line with 12% divergence!
The amount of Steins;gate comments did not disappoint.
EL PSY CONGROO

I am happy that Steins;gate references are the most upvoted in this thread. 
Have you got a build thread for this? It looks awesome as! 
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Is socool!
Has the 1% divergence been crossed? Is this truely the will of Steins;Gate??
I just just thought of making a divergence meter for my Steins Gate cosplay. What a nice coincidence :-).
Could you perhaps share the process of how you made it?
I see we've diverged quite a bit from 1%, so tell me... Who's survived so far?
Literally just finished watching Steins;gate and the the movie last night. It was really good
kurisuuu-tina best girl!
Hi David from Travellers!
Nice try Ahmed
r/steinsgate has taken over this thread
P P
I came to this thread from the alternate time line where there are no Steins;Gate references. It is not a world that you want to know.
I believe Nixie tubes look waaay better.
El. Psy. Congroo!
Cool clock, OP. Want to bring it to the White House?
This reminds me of Dirk Gently.
It has a cool anti-snooze function that wakes you up via shards of glass in your hand when you try to smash snooze
I want 10 please

Why not nixies?

Those are pretty cool! [I built a Nixie tube clock a few months ago](https://imgur.com/gallery/hAZRpHq)
Tutturuu!
A Nixie tube clock. 
Could that be classified "Steampunk"?
one of my managers at work has this, only the numbers are orange
Nixi tubes! 
With all the new LED filament style bulbs out there, it would be pretty cool to see these made in LED so you can customize the color & intensity
Tootoorooo
I'm literally watching this show right now r/nevertellmetheodds
Tuturu!
Tutturu!
I'm a mad scientist, it's so cool! Sonuvabitch!
Just to clarify, I DID NOT make this clock for those asking and sadly, it's not really mine. It's something my dad purchased since he collects a lot of junk. It was hand-made by the previous owner.

Although, I don't really consider this junk, I thought it was cool enough to post on Reddit!
El Psy Congroo
THE NUMBERS MASON!!!
CHRISTINA! How dare my assistant post this on @channel without my consent. What if Cern finds out that we have this?!
Kurisutina
LEDs made to look like VFDs made to look like nixie tubes. This is an abomination. 
Looks like the one from tomorrowland haha dope though. I love that movie.
Retrofuturistic? What the hell does that mean. 
Nah its missing the nixie aesthetic like [here.](https://i.imgur.com/VB8a6h4.jpg) 
Why does every thread have people clambering to make the same joke or reference? 
Wannabe nixie tubes, nice.
How did you get the 7 segment displays into the tubes?
Sweet! 
‘Cause I’m a retro-futuristic digital clock

I’ve got a lot to see, and I’m set up on a block

My daddy's a clever middle class intellectual

He threw out the old clock, so ineffectual 
Those are Nixie Tubes right? I've always wanted to try out making circuits with them but they're really expensive 😂.
You got a DIY link for your brethren?
retrofuturistic sounds like a made up word
I guess it says something about me and the media I consume that my first thought was Tomorrowland instead of Steins Gate
The answering machine is such irony!
Are those modified Nixie tubes?
Do you know the model of those tubes?
/r/diytubes
r/diy someone 
I would love to know how
Wow, it usually take longer for reddit to go off on a huge tangent. Nice clock!
Why is it made out of pepper grinders?
I... Need that.
Do you have a link to how you made it. I'm interested
Exceptionally fascinating!!
Would buy
Time, Time never changes
Instructions?
Got a tutorial to make this or a link to buy?
Your PP is small OP.
https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/7v5dzz/this_is_a_tube_lit_clock

I'm so jealous of your karma.(not really) I posted one my friend had a while back and attention was like "lame!" 
I feel like I've seen this in a movie or series recently.
Nixie tubes are the shit
What's that little metal thing on the table ?
Tomorrowland.
I want one!
Cool clock, Ahmed.  Want to bring it to the White House?
is that a nixie tube clock without any nixie tubes? looks digital. 
This should be in r/fuckingawesome
Steampunk?
Wait until this becomes a mainstream, Slimline product.
Link to diy how to? Just finished exams and lookin for something to do this summer.
Those look like tubes from a guitar amp, thats really cool. Im assuming you pulled them out of some sort of old stereo or amplifier right
Sweet but where do I plug the guitar in?
Wow how did you do that? That's awesome!!! Would love to do something like that myself
This is some cool shit man, awesome job!
You need to turn on the power to Teleport.
Dumb question: any particular reason this couldn’t have worked the minute electricity/light bulbs were invented? what other mechanics are going on here?
I think I'm about to spend $170 on a clock I have to build myself
Is retrofuturistic an oxymoron?  
Anyways, nice Steampunk clock. 
I’m curious about the Star/moon pottery in the background....
Very cool!! Should sell these on etsy! I would buy one! 
Where do people buy Nixie tubes online?
Is it on top of a custom built wine cooler as well ? Or is that a mini fridge?
For a second, I thought they were nixie tubes. Correct me if I'm wrong, but are those LED numerical displays inside of vacuum tubes?
Shut up and take my money!
Watch out for those wires. Nixie tubes require 90 volts DC to power. 
Nice...I want one!!
It's way more than mildly interesting. I'd even say that it IS interesting.
Did you make this? An r/DIY post with the how-to would be great! ;)
Looks like the clock from tomorrowland. Nice.
Good old Nixie tubes. Those never get old
I’m waiting for a comment where someone says s/he has one that’s feet-made. 
It's a Nixie tube clock.  Super cool.
Amp tubes! 
Seven segment VFDs. Any reason why those over older style Nixies?
I’ve always wanted to make one of these, but they seemed cost prohibitive in the past. 
How did you build?
This gave me a boner. 
Awesome. Great job
Ze vunder vaffle!

Looks like the WunderWaffle special weapon from Zombies in Call of Duty
someone is missing some of their flat pack furniture hardware
ouch my eyes
Looks like shit . 
How do you make one of those?
Excuse me, flight attendant? The man sitting next to me appears to be assembling a bomb.
Nixes! 
Sorta neat, but pretty ugly 
I want one.
Just finished rewatching Steins;Gate yesterday.
I just finished steins gate yesterday, so i was expecting this comment section
Where did you get the LED nixie tubes? 
Huh, that looks like a cheaper alternative to traditional nixie tubes.
Things like these remind me that I don't know how to do anything.
Huh, I just came across this elsewhere today. Nice! 
What does the little p stand for?
Does anyone have a tutorial on how to make one of these?
That’s lit 
...*did the number change?*
7 segment displays in  Nixie tube housings? What is this madness??!! 
For those wondering what it's supposed to look like, look up Nixie tubes.
Dirk gently
DIY anywhere??

I want to do this, tutorial?
They look like mini salt shakers
Oh, oh that's fucking cool...!

Nixie tunes are so expensive - are those LCDs  cheaper than standard nixie tubes?
That's awesome
/r/designporn 
Isn't this just a kit from ebay? I mean it's cool, and if you did it from scratch mad props, but I know there are lots of kids for these floating around and if so, it's hardly brag worthy
For the people complaining that they aren't using real Nixie or VFD tubes, aren't you happy that such a finite resource isn't being wasted on a clock? The layout looks a lot like the Nixie QTC clock kit I put together a few weeks ago. The kit is expensive and hopefully the OP saved some money this way. If they're going for an 80's aesthetic more than a 50's one, it's more appropriate too.
/r/nixie
I need this for my guitar room.
My boyfriend made me one similar too. I love it. 
I don't get any reply in here.
It’s very cool but out of place with the rest of the stuff on that desk.  I’m not saying the whole house has to keep the aesthetic but maybe have a similar theme in a small localized area?
Oh that looks amazing 
I had a friend who made one of these recently! It looked kinda similar to this one 🙄
I made the same egg shaped sculpture 1m tall, in a six week Terra Cotta course in JHB South Africa. It's still in our garden but I broke the top off by accident. So it has become a pot holding a another plant pot inside. Quite an edgy look 
This is pretty cool, how did you do it?
Cool never seen blue ones before.
OP HOW DO I GET ONE 
Now this well make for a nice talking peace.
Or a nixiemclock.
What's with the Ps? 
I think you mean Steampunk?
A digital version, of an analogue version, of a digital clock...
Nixie tube clock , awesome! 
Lol re-finished the first Season of the anime last night in preparation for watching Zero. Then I see a load of Nixie-tube-looking things on my front page 
Huh. What are the odds? I was in a store just an hour ago where they had one of these. Neat!
You mean bomb.
LED imitationNixie tubes... Hm
Would have been super cool if it used actual nixie tubes, but that's neat either way
So original, just like the clock in Project T
Nixie tubes, I haven't seen nixie tubes since I opened my desk drawer in the basement.
Look to be vacuum fluorescent displays.
Made to look as much like [nixie tubes](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU768AU768&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=TEbbWoGOHcaw8QXplbX4Dw&q=nixie+tubes&oq=nixie+tubes&gs_l=psy-ab.12...0.0.0.68293.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.lERewlAFSNs) as possible. That tells you which one is better.
r/retrofuturism 
What’s your PayPal
Take my money I want it lol
it's a kit, just buy one. they're LEDs made to look real, so it's not too expensive.
These are VFDs, not LED based.
I think this was someone's DIY projects from r/DIY
But how much would you charge for making one? I have a friend I'd like to get this for
Someone else said it’s a kit you can buy on amazon. 
I would just get the kit and make it myself, no need to pay someone to do it for you. They're LED and inexpensive, and come half assembled already.
:D got a link for the kit?
Whoa, are they nixie tube casings?
This is awesome, I'd buy one
This is way beyond mildly interesting.

/r/interestingasfuck
Nixie tubes are way nicer
no fucking clue what the majority of the comments here are referencing but let me tell you, this thing would sell so well! 
Sci-Fi series that deals heavily with Time Travel and the Butterfly Effect. Wvery time the character goes back and makes 
changes in time he shifts universes, aka "world lines." He has a device that looks very similar to this one that gives you the percentage of divergence from the base world line. 
it apparently does sell well. it's a kit you can buy on amazon and it's not actually real, according to half the comments here.
Can I get a DIY tutorial for this? 
Why not just make it out of actual nixie tubes?
Nixies are more expensive and require much higher voltage. And some prefer this look.
Does it work with reading Steiner ?
I never realized how popular Steins;Gate was until I met this thread
What do the little P’s mean inbetween? 
/r/quityourbullshit called and said they want their "Nixie Clock" back. The design is retro along with the tubes, other than that eBay sells them left and right. From kits to premade, $30.00 to $4000.00. Some sick art built in. The Steampunk ones are pretty detailed. Shit I have a "retro futuristic digital clock"... the digital part is the computer remembering the time and what filament/tube to change the numbers. Here's mine... https://imgur.com/a/9oK6R67
And some information https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube
I think [proper vacuum tube/nixie tube clocks](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/dc/77/e9/dc77e9ab76b34ce2cee0437940e917d9.jpg) look better, rather than this imitation
if it can do alarms, i would buy this off you
These are Nixie tubes. There was a post on r/artisanvideos where a guy makes them.

Most of them you could get when I built my clock were NOS Russian tubes. Also only like 30 bucks a tube. The guy from artisanvideos was selling them for like 200 a tube or something. 
Woah, those are some cool vacuum tubes.
Op did you make this?
fuuuuuuck nixie tubes. 
I NEED IT LINK PLEASE

Cool ass lamp
Ahhh reminds me of the Wonder Waffle from COD WAW and BO1 
Fuck, am I realizing I'm colorblind because I can't read this fucking clock?
I am the only who thought about Tomorrowland (the film) clock instead of steins gate?
Yes, but does your nixie clock have wifi? http://www.nixie.ai/2017/02/26/2018-new-release-omnixie-nixie-clock/
VACUUM TUBES DO NOT WORK THAT WAY.  GOOD NIGHT.
Are those lcd nixie tubes? 
Nothing new here - Nixie tubes have been around since 1955 and are as exciting as 7 segment led displays 
Nice one.
I like it, do you set it up on the back side, and does it also work as an alarm clock.
[removed]
No...not even close
I know right, there's nowhere to put the headlight fluid.
Give me give me give me gimmme!!!!!!!!!!
That’s awesome 
I'd love a tutorial or something on how they did this lol

Now that’s just interesting!
Awesome!
How it works? 
What are the small ones for?
Tomorrowland 
Wow, this cool!
Live the zebra wood 
"Retrofuturistic"... I've never heard this oxymoron word, but I like it! And it describes the clock very well! 
/r/retrofuturism
Yeah I saw a link to the sub in another comment. It isn't actually what I thought it was. I was thinking it referred to things designed now that look both retro and futuristic at the same time (fun oxymoron)... But it looks to just be stuff people in the past thought looked futuristic. 
i think this is more than mildly interesting
Less than if anything. I don't see why reddit considers a neat clock someone made to be interesting.
Isn't this from tomorrowland? 
[deleted]
Go spend $200 and buy one. 
Seeing the image: "So is the Steins;Gate reference going to be the first, second, or third comment?"

It's all of them.
We are in the world line without nixie tubes.

That is truly the most interesting thing in this photo, considering there are lots of kits out for these clocks. That said, maybe OP built it from scratch, but if so, a walkthrough of the build process would have made this post worthy, not just a final pic.

It is SERN in the anime/visual novel titled Steins;gate.

Those were nixi tubes.
it is
Looks like just LED seven segment displays inside some old glass tubes 
Vacuum floutescent display tubes. Same things car radios had for a while, just old versions.


Edit: not even real VFD tubes. 
No, these are real VFD tubes. Made at the same time and often by the same companies in the USSR that made Nixie tubes. VFD tubes have a longer lifetime and lower voltage requirements, so they came to replace Nixies in the 80s before both tube types got replaced with LEDs. 
Fake glasses? 
Yeah, this is lame.
Fake or not, it still looks real cool
Cool clock, OP. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.
No where near as cool as nixi tubes.
good luck trying to fit a digital led display through a real tube of that size 
Look up TGT Studios. He uses real tubes. It looks way better.
It's like the cheap Family Dollar bootleg toy section version of a real nixi tube clock. 
Exactly.
Hope it is, I don’t want to be in Beta

Maho-tan best Shaman;Girl.
This is what I was thinking!
Yup, first thing I thought of cause the wife and I noticed and discussed that clock as soon as we saw it in one of the episodes. Looks pretty damn cool. 
>It is not a world that you want to know.

It's a SERN legend.
Only thing is that they aren't manufactured any more and are starting to get more expensive. As times go on solutions like this will be more prevalent to reach the same anesthetic. 
I prefer VFD tubes actually. 
That's true, but I think they use tons of power? I'm torn. Would like a tube clock.
180 volts versus 30V for a VFD. High voltage, not power.
100%. This looks like a cheap thing you'd find at FiveBelow. 
Just strap to chest and run in.
came here to say this
At least this one is an actual unique electrical design, and not a radio shack cheap plug in alarm clock taken apart and put in a briefcase. 
There are dozens of us!

Honestly one of the best shows I've ever watched if anyone is looking to check it out.
^ this reminds me of Dirk Diggler.
^ this reminds me of punk country band Dick Wiggler and the Cattleguards.
Thank you for convincing me I don't need one. 
These are VFD tubes, not nixie tubes.
Fake nixie tube clock.
Not fake Nixies, VFDs are just a different but similar display technology.
Needs gears and a few random conduit tubes.
No, more a weird atompunk/cyberpunk blend.
Nope.

Oh...
I looked at what it’s supposed to look like and I prefer the original look than this. This is hard to read.  I had to really look at each number individually to be sure what number was showing. 
Nixie tubes can't be that expensive anyway.
Those are real VFDs.
That's a nixie tube clock
Yes! Exactly what I thought. More people should see that movie, it's wonderful.
/r/retrofuturism
What people thought the future would look like in the past. Think flying cars, robot maids, Fallout, The Jetsons.
They aren't LEDs, they look like IV-6 of IV-11 VFD tubes, manufactured in the 70s-80s in Russia. 
He bought the kit on eBay with the tubes pre made
They come like that. And they are 8-segment LEDs, my dude. They got that dot.
Lol no these are those 8-segment LEDs like at Radio Shack (RIP) just stuffed into fake tubes. It's hella lame.

Edit: this is false. They are VFD tubes.
This is false. They’re VFD tubes.
/r/retrofuturism
All words are made up
Search for nixie clocks on eBay, you’ll probably find them cheaper than on Etsy.
These are VFDs, so the voltage is much lower at about 30v. Nixie tubes require around 150Vdc iirc.
These are vacuum fluorescent displays, which require a lower voltage than Nixie tubes. They came after Nixie tubes and before LED displays.
You can't have an M in an 8-segment display, so s/he's probably using pp to represent PM.
Nixie tubes aren't steampunk.
Fourth, fifth, and sixth too.
Woah.... Just binge watched almost the whole series today.
If the post was even 1 day earlier I would have been confused by the comment. 
There’s a universe where there were no Steins;Gates references here...but this is not that universe.
haha me too
I need to finish that show... The first few episodes were a bit slow so I never got around to it but I've heard it's awesome

Edit: also it seems like the top 5 or 6 comments at least are all Steins:Gate
Only in this worldline, though.
It's a little rare to come across other people who've seen steins gate for some reason.

IT'S SO COOL
OwO
Still upvotimg, but straight talk? Okabe's treatment of Ruka in the first half was my only, ONLY problem with the series.

At least he seemed to grow past it near the end.
It's from a Visual Novel/Anime called Steins;Gate. You can watch it on Funimation, Funimation's official YouTube, and is pretty budget friendly on Bluray/DVD. 

Clocking in at only 24 episodes, an OVA, and a movie, it's my favorite anime of all time. Period. It's got a great cast, great dialogue, great OST, and the story is just incredible.

I highly reccomend it if you like character driven stories and more down to earth science fiction.

A semi-sequel/spin-off series is airing right now called Steins;Gate 0, but I would not worry about that until after you've seen the original.
12 precent? 

That's quite scary, actually. 

I don't want that. 

Give me that negative divergence. 
This thread has some confusing language within.

I've been meaning to watch this show since I see it all over the internet, but now you've finally pushed me over the edge. I'll watch it tonight.
I am so confused right now.

I haven't the slightest idea how an anime remix song has anything to do with a retro clock.
It's uploaded on to Zedge.
Fucking thank you that’s amazing

And these are designed to look like nixie tubes.
So... fake nixi tubes
Those are real VFD tubes.
How do you tell if they are real or not? They look similar to what I see when I search VFD tube but I don't know much about them.

Also are new VFD tubes or nixie tubes even being made? From what I can see on ebay and AliExpress the only ones for sale are old soviet ones that weren't or were barely used and are selling for >=$15/piece. Wouldn't mind getting some to play around with on my arduino but they are a bit prohibitively expensive if I want around 6 for clock making or whatever. 
Why would you say those are fake VFDs? I have those exact same tubes. IV-11 Soviet surplus. 
I have never heard of this, very cool. When were these used?
No we need to be in the Steins;Gate world line
I think you mean you want to be in the Beta.. That's the good one. 
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
It's the whole comment section, really
Link? 
I was waiting for someone to comment that fact, this really should be further up ffs
If watching Taika Waititi movies has taught me anything, it’s a New Zealand thing.
I have no problems with that, just lemme uh, microwave this here banana first
Wait until you see how much they cost. My fiancée and I had the same discussion, ending with a "well that's a lot".
Looks like VFD tubes. Still pretty cool.
yeah it's a cool idea but kinda hard to read... whew it's 0 40 8 08 0 01 4 o'clock, time to hit the hay.
If you want the newly made high quality ones, they are.

Right?! English is one big clusterfuck
Maybe there are different types of nixie's. I build a clock a lot like this with Nixie's and it was 90v per tube.

Now we are two
And if I somehow ended up in that universe, I'll be the Okabe to get myself out of there. However many world lines that's going to take
After watching it for the first time I didn't get it, but I rewatched it last month, because of second season. Now it's my favorite anime.
For sure, making references sounds insane if someone hasn't seen it. Is so cool, sonuvabitch
El Psy Congroo...
Nice to see this post when Steins Gate 0 is ongoing
Is it that rare? 

I guess we just don't show up often then, in that case...
With Steins;Gate 0 airing we'll probably be seeing a lot more soon.
Most of them become jelly for mysterious reasons... .. 
Tu turuuuu
I finished watching this last week, crazy to see this on reddit. 

I thought it was super popular? 
Looks so much like a divergence meter cause of the Nixie tubes 
Not subbed to /r/anime I take it. 
Steins Gate is the best.
Not as rare as you’d think on reddit
Great show.
Oh. It's anime. 
Yes. And it's great.
Can confirm, I have one of these clocks in my living room. I always get comments about it
This must be the work of the Organization!
I agree

I'd add that the visual novel is brilliant - quite a lot longer than the anime though. I'd also say that it can feel a little slow-paced for quite a long time - but that that truly pays off.
Thank you so much! Exactly what I wanted to see. Sounds pretty cool. 
Well the numbers don’t lie
Mine too since 2011, but seriously my phone has been in silent mode for years either.
You have no idea how glad i am you posted that!
That background music straight up sounds like a super sped up version of Theme of Laura of Silent Hill 2.
don't forget Steins;Gate 0 [the sequel] just started and is on episode 3!

Yup. I make phone calls etc. now and again.
Oh man you just reminded me of these, I loved rotating the dials when i was a kid. I wonder if there's a way to rip out the guts and turn one into a VoIP phone with a raspberry pi or something *thinking emoji"
Caller ID scrolling across nixie tubes :D couldn't be that hard, he's already got a 6 digit nixie tube display and a stand alone caller ID. 
I wouldn't say that.  I've seen [one](https://i.redd.it/x4halfyk29t01.jpg) fairly recently.
>but he's a guy

*Laughs in Sneaky cosplay*
Nope. These are designed to look like VFD tubes. The segmented display is a dead give-away.
Vacuum flourescent... totally different. Basically a triode tube with a phosphor added to produce light.
Modern Nixie tubes*
Besides the price, nixie tubes require a pretty high voltage. I don't know about you, but when I'm around 170V DC I tend to get a tad nervous.
The ones from OP are real. [I'm looking at one right now.](https://i.redd.it/4cmnzt2lgat01.jpg) 
Somebody just posted this video on r/artisanvideos https://youtu.be/wxL4ElboiuA it takes a TON of work and they're a bit pricey. 
Look closely, they're LED displays put inside a glass envelope to emulate those Soviet displays.
[Mild Spoiler] Neither, as far as I remember (watched it yesterday) they changed the line again, so its not alpha or beta, it’s the Steins;Gate line...or something like that, time travel it’s difficult shit 
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Hououin Kyouma, the mad?

Search "Nixie clock led" you'll find some in between all the way cooler nixie tube ones :P
I just need to make a quick phone call...
Fake vfd tubes
Yes and yes.
Exactly how I felt when I tried to read it. Broke my brain this morning. 😂
I find this amusing. I thought of this in the first couple seconds and it seems I'm not alone
Interesting, I know I'll need to watch it but atm Boruto, Black Clover and now My Hero Academia are keeping me busy. (Plus West world is starting back up tomorrow!!!). Too many shows too little time :/

Is it any good? I'm re-watching the original rn 
I'm waiting for the time (if and) when maho comes to know about the time machines
Yeah. The only people I know to have watched sg are the ones to whom I recommended it.

I believe a large factor at play is the first episode. I've noticed people stop watching it after the first episode as it's "too confusing". The truth is that you can't understand the first episode till you watch the very last.
Shouldn't be. I mean, it's #5 on myanimelist's top Anime.. List. And Zero has taken #3 currently. 
If you don't keep a low profile the organisation will have an easier time finding you
I finished it yesterday, for me its super crazy seeing this on reddit 
Just saying that from my experience. Maybe that just goes to show I'm not that very social.
I'd chime in and say the VN is by far superior in terms of content and pace, but that goes without saying since its the source material and you have the illusion of control over what happens and when it haopens. 

Of course, I'm not discounting the anime, which makes the story so much more accessible to the general audience that would never have heard of the series if it had remained solely in the form of a visual novel. Invest a little time into appreciating the source though, and wow, there's so much more to the characters, lore, and drama than what you get in the anime. Then there's the voice acting that's just so impressive - you get a chance to hear the voice actors stretch their vocal range simply because of the excess in content, and they're all spot-on in their roles. 

The VN is long, and for good reason. Anyone interested in some really good storytelling and has had this series caught your eye, do give the visual novel a go. The reward of getting to the end credits is incredible.
 > 3!

3! = 6


Did they have to use every special character on the keyboard when naming it though?
Oh i thought it's a movie. Super thank you for this information.
The Zero VN was really good. Played through it in like a week when it came out.

Pretty sure I'll just wait and binge the anime when its done.
Sort of a sequel.
well not a sequel to episode 23 and 24 but to 23beta :D and still a sequel to episode 22

well ill be. never heard of these things
I know them feels.
How many amps though?
That's advantage of VFD tubes vs. nixies; no high voltage.

Here's a [kit that adds VFD tubes to an Arduino](https://www.elektor.com/iv-3-vfd-shield-for-arduino-kit-150064-71) and turns it into a clock,  thermometer, volt meter, score board, counter, or whatever else you want to create.
I have an exposed nixie clock sitting on my desk in my room. I just know not to touch the tube sockets.
>I don't know about you, but when I'm around 170V DC I tend to get a tad nervous.

Not too nervous and that's probably why I shouldn't use them haha. I bought a 100W LED and driver and decided to ban myself from using it not too long after I got it once I thought about how little I know about electronics and I'm screwing around with mains powered 12V at 8.3A. Maybe one day when I feel I've earnt it I'll use it again. 

Are VFDs much safer to use? 

Neat, shame they aren't in mass manufacture anymore as those ones are going for $145/piece 😬. Makes the old soviet ones look like a bargain. 
Look closely and you can see the heater filaments. I'm telling you I have those exact tubes and you have no idea what you're talking about.
Nope. Those are VFDs.
These are real VFDs. They came in Nixe/valve packages before being miniaturized into integrated flat modules.
No, I'm fairly sure they mentioned that the Steins;Gate world line was a sub line of the Beta main line. 
In my understanding alpha worldline is where SERN is tapping into phone microwave resulting WW3.

Beta worldline is where phone microwave doesn't exist but Kurisu still died, hence her father claiming her paper resulting WW3.

And S;G worldline is where phone microwave doesn't exist and Kurisu isn't dead.

CMIIW please
It's not a story SERN would tell you, it's a Future Gadget legend

Man, you guys weren't kidding. Nearly *all* of the top comments are references to it. Mission accomplished, right there.
SONNNAVABIIIIIIITCH
KONGROO!!!!
**SUNUVABEETCH**
The VN is great, and the first two episodes are matching it pretty well. It introduces the best character.
If the first two episodes are anything to go by this season is going to be even sadder than the first one. Just make sure to watch episode 23b before you start or you might be a bit confused.
It only has 2 episodes so far so its hard to compare with the original but you should still watch it
I recommend watching tup to episode 22, watch 23 beta (missing link), and then don’t watch 23, 24, or 25 and start Steins;Gate 0.
It's okay, but not nearly as good as the original. Don't watch it if you want to remember steins gate as a 10/10 show.
😭😭😭😭
Disregard that nonsense, it's spectacular so far
there a dub? i go back and forth on anime but iirc i liked steins dubbed
I think Funimation has yet to get their hands on it -- to be honest will probably be a year or so before there's a dub
Nope, iirc the dub is actually being released on a 3 week delay.  So wait one more week and you'll be able to watch it dubbed 
Funimation has the rights to it, the dub will come out on the 30th at 1600. 
It's why I love the name of the first episode. 

>Prologue of the Beginning
and the End
The BEST part of Steins;Gate is that the beginning makes little sense, and then the dots are connected later. I love shows like that such as Black Mirror.
It's also boring af for like the first 4 episodes.

Edit: one of my favorite anime, just first few episodes stuck. Gets very good at episode 6 I think
I thought it was a reference to Star Trek Voyager.

There's more??
What are the other 3?
El psy congroo 

Edit: how are you not emotionally devastated after only finishing watching it so recently

The girl at the switchboard says I have to stop calling to ask her questions. I have no idea.
Ronald Reagan?! The actor?!!
The eighties are calling. They want their foreign policy back.
I mean, with Reaganomics in full swing, its basically the same.
Yup. He tells Gorbachev to tear down that wall etc now and again.
You can drive each tube on a few mA. But it can still be dangerous, as you'll need to limit the current output of the supply, otherwise it'll most likely be able to deliver considerably more current.

Personally I like the steampunk look of a wooden cabinet with nixie tubes protruding, but I also enjoy not being zapped. 
Just give me an impedance and I'll tell you.
Yeah me too, but I have kids. Although my kids are very smart (as they are mine), I don't trust them to not "have a look with their fingers" (as they are my kids). I'm in the process of introducing them to electronics, so I'd like to not scare them off by zapping their fingers. 
VFDs are much safer to work with. You can directly drive most at ~12VDC. In practice, with multiple digits, they are multiplexed at 20-50V. 
Personally I'd be much more comfortable with 100W as 12V 8.25A than 200V 0.5A. The 200V will kick you, but at 12V you won't feel it. All you need when dealing with that high a current is a bit thicker wires, or you'll burn something. 
Oh snap.
The heater filaments light up orange, and they don't have segments, just straight numbers. Those are definitely LEDs, you can just tell from the way the number is written
Look closely, we're all assholes.
The Steins Gate worldline is in the beta attractor field, I think. I mean It's 1.048596, so above 1%.
But in the beta assistant...
I saw a graphic with the alpha line being the main one, but I don’t know if it’s correct, I’m new into this lol
Fake time 
HOERRY SHIIIIIIT
The legal loli?
I wouldn't recommend that for first-time watchers. S;G0 tells its story under the assumption that you already know what *should* have happened.
Oh... You want maximum suffering. You monster
The thought of doing this without having already seen the ending of the first show both frightens and intrigues me. It would lessen the surprise twist near the end of the original but the comeback would be intense. 
I just binged SG for the first time last weekend. I'd never heard of it, and I'm not a huge time travel guy. But goddam if the writing for it wasn't some of the sharpest and most entertaining I've seen in an anime.  It's rare that I have felt *that* good after watching an anime series (usually I don't make it past a few episodes, to be honest), and I'm surprised I hadn't heard about it before. 

I watched the dubbed version, and I've been wondering if they gave the translator artistic license to Americanize the script a bit, because there were a lot of references I wasn't expecting to translate that well from Japanese. Daru especially felt a bit like he was given more of an American pop culture sensibility. I could be wrong, though. I haven't really studied up on modern Japanese pop culture.
Yes exactly. But people cannot appreciate this fact if they give up after the very first episode.
I'd argue that, honestly. The first half of S1 is setup - the characters slowly learning the rules and mechanics of how it works, and each other while still being genuinely funny and sweet to watch is integral to the 'good' parts of the show. Without the build up, without getting emotionally attached to these characters, the pay off just wouldn't have the impact it did.

I also grew up reading Heinlein and Asimov, so maybe I'm biased with slow paced sci fi.
I agree, I thought it kinda boring until the tone shifted from a comedic/slice of life into a triller sci-fi. One of my favorites and I'm glad I stuck through it.

Nah, they're talking the guy who was governor.
I have a degree in Industrial Environmental Health & Safety Engineering and I have close to zero knowledge in electricity. How does one power a Nixie tube if someone were to buy them off eBay? Better question, how do you make it a clock? So many questions. If you haven’t figured by now, I have a project a stewing. 
[You mean like this?](https://i.redd.it/ge2ix5u69at01.jpg)
Nixies don't have segments. VFD tubes do. Just [look at the one on the Wikipedia aricle for VFDs](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Vacuum_fluorescent_1.jpg)
And no, the heater filaments don't light up orange on VFDs, not at normal voltages. You don't know what you're talking about.
It's [Vacuum flourescent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluorescent_display?wprov=sfla1) not led.
Yeah, my guess is that every percent is a separate attractor field? I'm not sure though, because in the game there's a Gamma field I think, and that might have a divergence of between 1 and 2%
How can time be real when our clocks are fake? 
OHMAH GODDDD
BAAAD ASSS
yup
I watched the sub and references mostly related to tsuderes, 4chan, and anime. Did the dub change stuff to American stuff?
I think going in *knowing* that this is what's going on is necessary. Some shows are legitimately slow because they suck
Definitely - you need that slow buildup to truly be drawn into it for the second half. The same goes for the visual novel, but more so, considering it's significantly longer.
No, you’re absolutely correct. The first few episodes are slow but it makes each new revelation that takes place during this time that much more impactful. I got chills when the banana appeared miraculously reattached. It’s such a small thing but it expertly sets the tone for what’s to come, 
That must be the most we've ever had above a gintama series

Next thing you're gonna tell me is what, The Cubs will win the major league? There will be a  Jaws 19?
There's good tutorials on instructables. I would start with something easier though, or buy a premade power supply. It's a pretty difficult introduction to hobby electronics.
I've only done a little bit of research into it, but this might be a good place to start: https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/7yxgo2/i_designed_an_opensource_nixie_tube_driver_module/
Nixie tubes are a bit dangerous to work with as a novice, as they require ~200VDC to operate. They are basically small neon lamps. 

If your wall power is 220, you can just rectify that. I'm in the US, so I use a boost converter from DC. You can get power supply kits for nixies on ebay and the like. Then you can switch each digit on with a high voltage NPN, or there are more specialized driver chips.

You can also get kits to make them into clocks, but that still involves working with high voltage. VFDs are much safer to work with, if you want to go that way. 
Yeah I replied to the above comment saying I got it wrong.

Also it's pretty cool to get my own handwritten answer from a stranger online
What ink and pen?
Ah I see, didn't check what VFDs were before I wrote that comment. My bad, was talking about nixie tubes

In the vn there's an Omega field and the divergence number shows "-" in place of the first digit, and SPOILERS FOR THE FARIS ENDING in that worldline it doesn't seem like Mayuri dies, don't know about Kurisu though.

The gamma attractor field is on a cd (which I'm gonna give a listen to later today). 
SONA CHI NO SADAME
Not really that stuff, but they did reference a bunch of western memes and reddit a few times. 
Nah, there were a lot of those references.  I don't know, maybe it was just the voice actor.  The guy they got to voice Daru was amazingly good at capturing the character.  Actually, the entire english voice cast was fantastic.  Usually there's one or two in a cast that annoy the hell out of me, but I don't remember having that issue at all throughout this series.
