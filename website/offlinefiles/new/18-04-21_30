I would’ve fainted if I found out Beyoncé could’ve been my mum

Well if he stayed with Beyoncé you wouldn’t exist.
Well if he liked it he should have put a ring on it. 

Edit:  that song is probably about OP’s dad. 
Imagine dating someone, breaking up and then they become one of the most famous people on the planet lol I’d hate my life 
Ok the right photo is a crop of a meme.

Just let me for a second question its validity.
In the first pic he looks like Kanye
This pics have been circulating for years now, what gives, OP?
r/thathappened. 


https://m.ranker.com/list/beyonce-knowles_-loves-and-hookups/celebrityhookups

This same post makes the rounds every few months
Better lookin than HOV
Still a better looking dude than jayZ. 
the one on right has printed words. did op cut this out of a magazine?
[deleted]
Absolute bullshit. Oh, he just thought of it now? After all these years? Fucking liar.
Imagine having 99 problems but crippling financial ruin ain’t one of them :/
You wouldn’t have existed. And there would be a totally different child, OP!
dad looks like Kanye as Carlton Banks 
Your dad is official cooler than Beyoncé.
You would have never existed if they were still together 
Beyoncé is seriously overrated. Mediocre vocals at best. 
Beyonce says she thinks that im cute.

Thats alright beyonce, I think youre cute too.
My sister went to elementary school with the Olsen twins. She was friends with them for a while, but my sister has a short temper and got into an argument with them. They were no longer friends.
Noone is asking the important question here, and it's disappointing.

Did he fuck her?
Imagine being the mom knowing your husband married you instead of Bey. 
So you're telling me your dad didn't know beyonce was famous until he heard you talking about beychella?

yeah, I don't believe you.
OP you’re a fucking uneducated dumbass
Thats not how procreation works. Jesus.
Was he the first
When you find out your dad was the inspiration for the best thing I never had. 
I know someone that might know you 
He wasn’t ready for Sasha Fierce!!
It sucks to know that she will never think about him ever. 
That's got to be sort of a mindfuck for the mom. People get weird about exes as is, never mind some shit like this.
that dad is way better looking than Jay Z
poor mom. getting compared to beyonce all the time must be rough.
Kudos, she was way prettier when your dad dated her.
Pull out game was too strong. Fat mistake
Did your dad know Harris Wittells? He went to highschool with Beyonce and was friendly with her.
So when you say could’ve been your mom. Did he tap dat ass. 
It's fake. That dude photoshops himself into photos like that
That dude look like Kanye in the first pic 
Both of these photos have been on the internet for a while....
Those photos must be from forever ago. Isn't she 45?
Pulled out the pictures, pulled out the dangus too
Too bad he pulled out. 
Yeah. We all know why you used the words “pulled out” 

I guess he didn’t like it otherwise he woulda put a ring on it 
Your dad is 1000x better looking than hova...
your dad looks suspiciously like a young nas...
At the exact moment this was posted, Blue Ivy, Rumi, and Sir Carter collectively and unexpectedly breathed a huge sigh of relief. 
What's your mum look like
He's a qt pie
to the left
My mom once casually brought up that she went on a date with O.J Simpson once and I was like what
The question is did he pull out back then too
Who makes these pics with text at the top and where do they post them originally?
Didn’t the guy dating Beyoncé in high school cheat on her multiple times?

Is this person bragging that their dad was a piece of shit??
Why hasnt this been removed? Mods asleep?
Oh I get it, you want some karma. 
Dad had on at like 17?
Can you imagine being that guy, damn I dated her in HS. He peaked in HS. 
Tbf if he made a baby with Beyonce it wouldn't be the same person as OP in the pic
On the bright side, your dad likely has a song about him out there
> I would have fainted if I found out beyonce could've been my mom

damm dude imagine being this fucking guy and your first instinct is "fuck I wish this celebrity who doesn't give a fuck about me is my mom. Oh hey mom ya I'll have breakfast thanks for giving birth and raising me but tbh I really don't give a fuck about you compared to this current celebrity."
r/oldschoolcool 
Never tell me the odds that Beyonce has dated the father of a Twitter user? How mentally handicapped are the people who upvoted this?
For real tho, do he hit that?
Those pictures are not the only thing he pulled out.
My grandma was asked out by Kenny Baker (R2D2). Turns out he was really drunk and acting like an ass, so she turned him down. He was also half her height, which didn’t help
Are people really still talking about Beyoncé?
Dad *watching blurry video of the performance on the kid's phone* "Wait a minute.. Beyonce you say?,  I think I dated her in high school.."

Kids: yeah, sure dad. 


Dad: *pulls out pics.*

Kids: "..."
Plus her music is uninventive
Why is Beyonce considered talented anymore
Did he bang her?
Whats is your doing with pictures of his exes?😂😂
Yes, the odds of Beyonce having been her mom are therefore absolutely zero.
Life is so weird. Like if his dad stayed with beyonce, would he have been born but in a different body? He wouldnt know since even if it was him, he has different experiences and a different personality so technically it isnt him, but it could be him, youll never know. If thats true then every human on Earth is the same person, born as a blank slate that is drawn upon on your experiences and random stochastic thermodynamics. So technically we are all the same person, but different people somehow, idk.
You could say he's Irreplaceable
His dad would probably be willing to make that sacrifice.
This sounds like the BEST case scenario
He more likely would just have a different dad lol. Its the mom that gave birth to him. 
OP would exist. Beyonce would just be his mom
Damn it.
Guess he wasn't irreplaceable
He wasn't Crazy in Love
Does he still have all of his things in a box to the left?
>Imagine dating someone

:(
Or you could be happy for them and motivated by the fact that you were part of a 'success story' even if only by proxy.
A family friend dated Tiger Woods when they were attendingStanford together, just as a big buzz about him was getting started. He cheated on her so they broke up. Imagine my surprise when it came out he was cheating on his wife lol 
A friend of mine married some dude, divorced him because "the chemistry was off" (She was more attractive than him, she was into going out and clubbing he wasn't that social, she said he bored her) In the span of 5 years after the divorce the dude founded a tech company, sold to a tech giant for an undisclosed amount and now he's worth between nine and ten figures. He's the one clubbing now, has famous friends and he's a bit more 'fun' to say the least. I have the privilege of being friends with him on fb since I know him before he blew up which is why I know he was backstage at coachella and rented out a mansion and flew there private, the whole nine yards.

My friend is a teller at bank of America and still single, I don't know how much she's making but I hope she's happy though. Not that money = happiness but I hope she doesn't regret the decision.
What if I told you being rich and famous is not the peak of human aspiration? When you grow up things change.
I wouldn’t - id be grateful it ever happened. 
In my wife's friend group from college there is a guy we know who was married to a woman who divorced him and left him to go join the porn industry. She's a quite popular actress that I'm sure many of you would be familiar with. 
This is why I always bail first. Then I can imply I was too good for her.
I was going to say imagine being the woman to come after Beyonce.
Why. 
An ex of mine is a meanwhile relatively famous actress. Not Beyoncé level famous, but Sarah Michelle Gellar level famous. I hate to see her in the newspaper once in a while, but otherwise I don't really think about it. 
If i had to be miserable though? Nah. 
The closest is my mom dated the maker of dnd’s son
Watch the social network. Gf broke up with zuc but she put him in his place. Worth it
I googled Kanye’s ex gf not long ago and she seems to be doing well. I bet she met so many rich people when she was going to events and restaurants with Kanye so it doesn’t surprise me. Her name is Alexis Phifer if anyone was curious
Must sting even more that she married Jay-Z. I love Jays music, but he is not a handsome lad lmao

Also if he broke up with her then rip to that guy 
I think I'd be really happy for them. 
I'd just be convinced I was keeping them from succeeding.

/scumbagbrain
She was famous since like 16 pretty sure she was famous while they dated 
In America* not on the planet. Why are you so eurocentric without realizing it 
I'm hoping the Dad just found pictures on the internet and showed them to his kid to mess with him hahaha
Looks more like a crop of something out of a yearbook? Or some sort of high school print.
It's a photo of a magazine.
[yeah. there are memes of this guy floating around. there's no way OP just found out ](https://i.imgur.com/pkT3Ivu.jpg)
In the second pic he looks like Kanye. Does this mean that Kanye is to Jay Z as Ray J is to Kanye? Is that really why they had a falling out?
In the second picture he looks like Shaggy
lookin like ol dirty bastard
Reminds me more of Chris rock
He actually looks like my one black friend I have.
He looks absolutely nothing like Kanye in either photos 
Get em!
OP is a filthy liar

I honestly don’t know how I would feel if people were getting track of my personal life like that
So in 2 years she went from not being famous and dating her Highschool sweetheart to Jigga??? That’s bad ass. I’d like to know the degrees of separation, from her to Jay Z. 
Is this photoshopped?
I think that’s most men
Most dudes are 
Compared to me jay z is lazy.
The guy apparently gave multiple interviews, his name is Lyndall Locke.

OP never claimed it was their picture. In fact he distinctly implies that its someone elses picture with the wording of the title.
My dad went on a couple of dates with Farrah Fawcett when they were students at UT in the late 60's. He never thought to mention it for 4+ decades until it was in the news that she died a few years ago.  He just said he never really thought about talking about it because she wasn't "Farrah Fucking Fawcett" at the time, she was just a cute girl at school.
If he’s anything like my dad he would have mentioned it when she first got famous and made lame dad jokes about it periodically throughout my life. Plus if the guys young enough to have dated Beyoncé, it’s not like he’s going to be so out of the loop he just didn’t know that she was famous.
bro careful with that the beyhive is fierce!
You said it, man.
Well yeah, cause it's a fake post 
She's 36
Apparently she Dated once before Jay Z but didn't have sex with them
RIP
Then tell us who you consider as talented and get roasted 
Because she's talented.

Not my style, but give credit where credit is due.
wut
MOOOOODDDDSSSS
MODS?!?
When chances are low, the odds are high
But, would OP know that?
If his dad jerked off once more he’d be a different person too
Maybe you should take a biology class. If his dad never broke up with Beyoncé then this dude would never exist in any shape or form. The offspring of his dad and Beyoncé would be a completely different human. 
If you really want to bake your noodle (as if you hadn't already), go find some Alan Watts lectures about what "you" are. Your confusion stems from thinking that a person is a discrete thing with a clear boundary, but really we're all tangled in with each other, and the idea of "me" and "you" is just a helpful, albeit inaccurate shorthand.
Dude 4/20 was yesterday.

We're not, we are, I do, you're wrong.


This is nonsense, but the idea that I would never have had to listen to her voice if OP's dad stayed with her and butterfly effected her from becoming famous... this intrigues me
You’re an idiot
This is the kind of thing I would have found super deep in high school.
OP would have been a totally different person with different DNA and upbringing.  OP would never have been born.
I assumed OP was a she

Uhhhh hopefully you learn something from some of these replies bc that is a really dumb statement 
But then it wouldn't be OP, it would be a different person all together.

Tiger Woods smiled at me one time :(
What's the alternative here? Should she have stayed with someone she didn't like? It makes no sense.
What if the divorce was his motivation to do all that? I don’t know the people, but at least in regards to the partying he did after he gained wealth, maybe he’s doing that because of her?
I had a coworker that was pretty but a very bitter woman. "Almost married a pro baseballer, but it didn't work out." Sounds like she was ruined by her own choices tbh.

That’s not what I meant. Rather that you’re doomed to hear their voice on the radio and people talking about them wherever you go.. 
also probably would cause some severe jealousy issues with future partners.
I don’t know how I’d feel if my partners ex was freaking Beyoncé 
This guy settles
Yes it is. Being rich is the only thing me, or most want. Live happy everyday, have 24/7 free time and never work again in your life. It's the only thing I really want.
I think Beyonce is pretty high up there for human aspiration.
Exactly. The thought of being famous (or married to someone that is) sounds fucking awful to me.
Lmao, like saying her name on Reddit is going to bring some negative attention or attack on her?
That dude probably won't be visiting any porn sites for a while 
Sounds tame for an adult actress backstory 
that's such a tease.
Lol pretty sure she’s famous worldwide, no? 
Or, more likely, that the post is a lie.
I'm getting more of a Ron Artest vibe in the second pic
If their dad had a movie he would be instant millionaire. Who wouldn’t pay to see Beyoncé getting banged by some random dude. 
r/thathappened is interesting because if you go there and see the posts.. you'll notice patterns that occur in all the made up stories. You can have a checklist and go through it and these similarities will come through in anything fake. 

So you kind of get this internal checklist going that sets off that recognition. Obviously theres the memes like Albert Einstein and everyone clapping but theres more too.

Like, if they aren't the best at relaying the story they're telling but within their story they're 10/10 wit and totally eloquent in telling off the caricature of a crotchety old racist lady, who at one point will shout "well, I never!"

Another good example is when a meme comes out saying their dad never said anything about dating Beyonce until they mentioned her performing at Coachella, followed by him pulling out easily googled photos of 'Lyndall Locke', (the guy in the photograph) who has done [fucking tv interviews from at least 2014 about the fact that he dated Beyonce.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc6fk-GaSLI)

Yeah, thats fair, but be honest.  We all know this didn't happen...  Maybe if it was a tweet from the guy I'd give it a second thought

Edit: Also, his name is Lyndell Locke.  You can Google him.
Because after all this time Coachella was the thing that reminded him...? You're right, YOU can believe, but there's no need for calling someone an insecure bitch just for not believing an obvious lie.
Bro you're a fucking idiot if you believe this is real. 
How in the world does posting that make /u/midnightsun183 an "insecure bitch"?
TIL that people on the internet never lie
Youre a fucking idiot. He literally posted proof. That dudes kid is 4. Stop being an insecure little bitch. 
The fuck does it have to do with insecurities? Do you believe everything you come across on this site? I surely hope not.

Pro level philosophy 
Or once less
I mean if I learned anything from biology class it’s that if his dad would’ve stayed with Beyoncé and his mom went off and married Shaquille O’Neil and then their offspring did potara fusion then you’d get the original kid just hangin way more dong and with the voice of an angel.
Well yeah, physically different, but what about his conscience. Technically, you wouldnt know that would you
/r/totallynotrobots 
When you're talking about the actual physical embodiment of the person, sure; but when they're exclusively talking about themselves in relation to their dad, then they could've existed as Beyoncé's kid as well; e.g. I'm my dad's first kid, if he only had kids with Beyoncé, I'd still be his first kid because he can only have 1 first kid, and that's me.
That’s if you BELIEVE the biology class and don’t know it’s the soul that makes a man not the semen 
I like this. Like a butterfly, my ears could be free.

Super deep? Just take a biology class your freshman year and you’ll learn basic shit. OP of this thread thinking that he would be born in a different body is so fucking stupid.

You're a combination of 11 unique elements that are found organically and your genes go back at least 2 million years.

~~All~~ *Some of* the stars you see in the sky are already dead, *maybe*, the earth spins on a rotation of about 1,000 miles an hour and we are communicating with just our thoughts.

And you think you're mediocre? What a pity.

There are two hundred billion other galaxies in our universe. In one of them, you are Beyonce. 
be glad the u didnt catch the nigger disease
I'm not saying it should make sense. If something like that happened to me it would be bullshit if I told you I wouldn't think about it consistantly. You bet I would wonder what if. For her sake I hope she's is and remains happy about the choice she made that's all. 
I think (and I've heard this from people who have 'made it') that money gives you confidence and some (obviously not all) people who don't go out often is because they don't have many friends to hang out with and it's difficult talking to women, have no game etc. Probably with money came the friends and the women (sad but true) and now he has dough to go to a club and rent out the vip,  bottle service and all that (which improves the experience dramatically). Maybe I'm overanalyzing this and that's not the reason who knows I don't talk this person I only follow him on social media..
Additionally, being rich isn't the peak of human aspiration. It's certainly nice, but I feel like people are too quick to put their entire emphasis on money.
If you broke up with them then you had reasons to not want to be with them. I see what you mean tho.
"Being rich" isn't what most people should want. People have this misguided notion that being rich = "living happy everyday," but that's not true. Though I agree with you on the "24/7 free time and never work again" aspiration. 
Only in the US people are obsessed with her. Outside of the US she's "just" famous, nowhere near one of the most famous people on the planet. Probably less famous than Taylor Swift outside of US

Thursday Next! 1st time I've seen Jasper referenced on reddit. 
Can't fault this kind of logic. You just know it has to be true.
What is a consciousness but the product of both genetics and life experience? If he has a different body due to different genetics, and a different life experience due to different parents, he's completely not the same person on any level. 
You must also believe in a flat Earth.
Wtf homie.  It would be a different sperm lmao.  Guys have more than one swimmer.
Conscience is birthed from electrical signals in the brain, which is birthed from DNA. I see what you mean though, philosophically it's interesting to think about. I just don't think there's really anything "special" about a consciousness that would cause it to be any different from another part of your body. It's kinda like saying "well maybe his arms would have still been born, just on a different torso" or something. I definitely do get what you're saying though
what if the mom had another child too, would the conscience be split between the two childs, Hint: no
said as you chew on paste in the corner
brilliant 
Wow
Can you define conscience?
I don't think you're conveying your thoughts the best (I don't blame you--it's tough to verbalize), but I know exactly what you mean. I have that thought quite a bit. Like if my parents had waited 10 minutes to conceive, would the baby born be *me*?
It wouldn't have been the same sperm to inseminate Beyonce's egg.

Different sperm, different egg, different person 100%.

Whoever would have been born would just share roughly 50% of their genetics.
The word you’re looking for is consciousness not conscience. They mean different things. I know yesterday was 4/20 but maybe you should take a break from altering yours.
No that first kid would be an entirely different person. If you were to go to an alternative universe where that happened then your dads first kid would be your step brother and he would not look or think anything like you.

Ouch this comment was so edgy I think I got a paper cut 
Having no money is definitely shit compared to having a lot of money. You cannot say you can be happier broke than well off. 
What if they broke up with you. Either way, under any given circumstances, whether you hate them or love them, it would sting like a mf 
> but that's not true

Would you like to explain why that's not true? I've been in a point in my life before where I wanted to killed myself from being so depressed about not being able to make ends meet due to not having enough income.

Being rich would definitely equal living happy everyday for me and I imagine many others as well.
Yeah of course the money doesn't make me happy.

What makes me happy is what I can do with the money. If I could stop working and still buy everything for the rest of my life I would be happy until my death.

Working makes one depressive, especially when I have day shift in the summer from 2-10...
Maybe but all my problems are caused by a lack of money. Its the missing ingredient in my life's recipe. 
I live in Germany and I overhear people talk about her regularly. Maybe not *as* famous as in the us but still pretty famous 
So you're saying you think this dad NEVER thought to mention to his kids about dating beyonce until today?
His child is 4 the post is a lie-it’s weird that you want it to be true so badly honestly 
That's...the same thing...

The lie states they were discussing Coachella, that's when he pulls out the images (=) 'Beyonce? Here's pics of me and her'

Regardless of what word I used, still doesn't justify this person's shitty behavior.
It's a matter of degree. It's genetics plus life experience. He would have had half similar genetics, and similar life experiences. If he were a totally different person, it would also imply that every choice you make from second to second makes you a totally different person from what you could have been. 
Dualism 
We don't really know what consciousness is yet, so nothing's completely certain in that area. 
Yeah, but lets say you go back in time and live a different life in a completely new place, different experiences, etc. Youd have a completely different peraonality, but would you be a different person. Who knows.
Genetics from the father remain. You only change the mother to Beyonce, dad is still the same dude.
>What is a consciousness but the product of both genetics and life experience?

Well this is a big question. Don't act like we've got consciousness all figured out. Believe it or not a lot of scientific minds believe in the metaphysical.
It would also be a different egg.
WHAT, the heck does sperm have to do with ones conscience
>Conscience is birthed from electrical signals in the brain

This isn't a fact. This is a huge topic with massive implications on the nature of the universe. People need to stop acting like the discussion is over.
I cant, which is why i have all these questions duh
Bad science. 
Unequivocally no. Different sperm, different arrangement of DNA, different brain firing, different person. Maybe raised almost exactly the same way until old enough to develop a personality or maybe the opposite sex and a completely different life experience.

But not you. You are that sperm plus that egg multiplied by time.
Less than 50% even. You would get a different different subset of genes from your dad.  It could potentially be much lower.
A "person" is a concept, not just the physical manifestation of a particular genetic sequence. I already said they'd be completely different persons from any point of view, *except* as the nth child of a particular person.

If you lose a strand of hair, are you a different person? Probably not. If you went to a different school, would you be a different person? Depends on how you look at it, but let's take the PoV where you're still the same person. Keep removing traits this way till all that's left to define you as a person is your relationship to your dad, then any person with the same relationship an alternate timeline would still be the same person, because they have the exact same defining characteristics.

Papa?
I love you.
Okay, well is the static we see on TV actually a percentage of the Big Bang or what? Because I've been throwing out these philosophical pseudoscientific pontifications ever since 1998, when The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer’s table.
- Carbon

- Hydrogen

- Oxygen

- Calcium

- Nitrogen

- Phosphorus

These are the big ones.

Then I guess Potassium, Chlorine, Sodium, Magnesium...and zinc?

uh that's kinda like saying every literature masterpiece that have existed and will exist is built up by 26 letters

kinda true but ehhh
Hence why I said having money is nice. 

However, you absolutely can be happier broke than well off. Hell, I was happier in college when I struggled to make ends meet than I am now with an extremely well paying job.
Sure, but I think just being comfortable financially  is good enough. Don't need to be super rich to be happy.
Unless you're an adult about it and move on.
Rich people have problems too dude. Their loved ones die. They can suffer from depression, IBS, seizures, alzheimers, literally everything that can happen to anyone. They know that they will one day die. They can have existential longings for a greater purpose than just being rich. Their life can be consumed by what they make money doing to the point they dont even have a life. They can never know if people actually like them or if they're just kissing ass for money. It can be very lonely. Vacations and luxuries aren't substitutes for genuine human connection. There's depressed rich and famous people. They exist. I'm sure you've heard of a few. [Money stops correlating with happiness well before you make enough to be in the "never work again" stage of life without retirement planning and decades of work like everyone else.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/374119002)
Conversely, I've been depressed to to the point of wanting to kill myself after getting a job paying six figures (in Iowa no less). The money is great, but I was much happier back in college struggling to make ends meet. 

What I'm trying to say is that money doesn't alleviate your problems or stresses. It just changes them. I mean hell, just look at all the celebrities and extremely rich who kill themselves and/or struggle with depression. Money isn't the cure. 
No doubt. But most people who are considered "rich" couldn't stop working and buy everything they want for the rest of their life.
Yes she is famous outside of US too, my point was just not as famous as people in the US think she is. I've lived in Germany too by the way! 
I said

“Regardless, the story is fake”

So... I know it’s not real. My point was that even the fictional story doesn’t say he forgot about Beyoncé
One implies that he forgot about her forever.

The other implies that he realized his kids haven’t ever seen the pictures.

Regardless, the story is fake.
"The lie" do you know 100% it's a lie?
I'm sure you wouldn't consider siblings the same person, but they'd check all those same boxes as well. 
But he would have been from a different sperm, so a completely different person. Like a half brother of the poster who would not have ever existed.
> it would also imply that every choice you make from second to second makes you a totally different person from what you could have been. 

Isn't this true though? Maybe not every choice, but key decisions chosen throughout life does make you a totally different person than you could have been.

Sure we are still discovering how the brain works, but Id say we are closer than you think. We are at least close enough to be all but certain that your consciousness isn't stored somewhere and assigned to you upon birth in some predetermined way. 

It's essentially the whole "blank slate" debate. We get physical traits from each of our parents which affects how we perceive stimuli but ultimately who you *are* (your consciousness) is heavily determined by your experiences growing up. Two people with exactly the same upbringing will end up different from one another. That goes back to physical differences, including but not limited to chemical balance (and structure) of our brains
Yes. If the events that shaped the person I am today had never transpired or had played out differently then I would not be me, I'd be someone else. I'd respond to situations differently, especially without the traumas I've survived. 
That just boils down to how you define "person". If you define it purely physical (I.E. All your DNA is the same) then no you're not. If you define it as the sum of your experiences then yes you are definitely a different person.

I think (and this is generally the accepted scientific look too) it's a mix of both. The traits we gain from our parents as a child are set in stone. If you were born to different parents then your DNA would be different. That's just a fact. But our experiences do have a significant effect on us throughout our lives. That isn't limited to the mind either - we actually change physically based on our surroundings as well.

Think of it like a video game: we start with base stats determined by our class (parents). Depending on what we focus on while playing we selectively modify those stats to suit our playstyle (experiences). Pretty much exactly like real life just waaaaay more simplistic haha. 
Conscience comes from our friend the brain.  Different sperm= Different brain = Different conscience.  It's why you also don't have conscience of your siblings.  Unless you control more then one body, that'd be pretty cool.
Consciousness is literally a property of your physical body. If your dna changes then the consciousness is different.

If it's a different sperm it's a different consciousness.
Look at it like this, if your dad nutted a minute later into your mom you would be an entirely different person.
At least half... I think. 
>ones conscience 

What do you think that is? Are you thinking about a soul that would exist regardless of the body that it's in? 
What other possibilities are there? Are our bodies getting puppeted around by an incorporal soul? Seems pretty open and shut to me.
How can I deny or agree with your statement if you’re unable to explain what you mean? At this point you could’ve just thrown together 5 random words and it would make as much sense as your comment. 

But if you were talking about conscience as in what makes him, him. Then yes I would know that the offspring of his father and Beyoncé would have a different “conscience” 

You could compare it to a step brother. Me fr-instance have a brother whom I share only my dad with and we couldn’t be less different. 
Its not really beetle juicing though because the barnacle reference was set up by the second person in reference to the poster above's username. Then the guy just responded.


That wasn't beetlejuicing.
Put me in the screenshot
:D
I miss the doing the dinosaur 
I zoned out during that episode of Breaking Bad, too
Look at this guy who thinks every literary masterpiece is in English.
should have gone with DNA for even fewer letters.
...but it sure helps.
What are these adults you speak of?
it's not so much about all those 'vacations and luxuries'. it's about being able to live each day of your life the way you want to live it. 

vacations and luxuries don't hold an interest for me. but being able to be outside hiking, kayaking, fishing whatever with my dog every day would be my billionaire lifestyle. I really can't stand airplanes, and fancy frivolous things annoy me. I guess what I mean is that it's all about freedom that money buys for, at least, me. 
we aren't talking 6 figure job rich. we are talking no job rich. 
Oh yeah, you’re right on that one, people don’t obsess over her nearly as much but everyone knows who she is. 
That’s cool, hope you liked it! 
>[pedantry intensifies] 
Hansel hes so hot right now, Hansel. 
But then you have cases with twins who don't know about each other who are raised by separate families. They end up having the same hobbies, going for the same major and living across the street from each other in another state from where they grew up. Running into each other on the street for the first time since their birth. 
He's talking about consciousness beun separate from the body, you're just treating it as if he's a mind-body dualist.
I dont even know anymore lol
Well no one really knows what consciesness is other than its what makes you self aware
Wait you’re right
Can we get a ruling in this, judges?
shh bby it ok
3 year old account. It checks out.
Im currently not able to upload, sorry
Me too
you know, i know that there are masterpieces in other languages. you know it too. everyone knows. that's the truth. there was just no need to clarify it until some fucking wannabe asshole know it all like you came here to shit on everyone because they need this little happiness in their life.

fuck you man
and electron proton neutron for even fewer
But you don't....your loved ones still die and your relationships can be trainwrecks. You can still be too busy to "live life the way you want to".
You can call it pedantry, I call it accuracy
Well yes, that's because you still do gain traits at birth that have a not insignificant effect on how you process stimuli. Identical twins share many of these traits and therefore will react to stimuli in a similar way. They are still different people with different personalities because of different experiences. Don't forget that while these studies highlight the similarities (which are important no doubt) there are conversely plenty of areas in which they are different from one another as well. 
Hey, glorioussideboob, just a quick heads-up:  
**seperate** is actually spelled **separate**. You can remember it by **-par- in the middle**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
it's cool if you are but that might be what you mean. in which case it's more of a philosophical question than a biological one
Consciousness is defined as the state of being aware of and responsive to one’s surroundings. Consciousness itself is not something that gives you awareness, it’s simply a state of being aware. What gives you consciousness or self-awareness is your brain. And don’t confuse “consciousness” with “conscience” if we are to define “conscience” as what makes an individual himself/herself. What makes you, you is partly genetics but mostly your life experiences. Your genetics will play a role in how you feel or perceive certain things but your life experiences is what moulds you into who you are today. 
It's a furlong before the next parsec.
He responded to UglyBarnacle, that comment was made because of his name, thus not beetlejuicing
not me though
something elegant about going from ingredients to letters tho.
delete yourself for shaming me bot
Would you say two newborn babies are the same person from a metaphysical standpoint
> What gives you consciousness or self-awareness is your brain.

We don't know this. People need to stop acting like this is some "case closed" situation. We don't fully understand consciousness. Plenty of people in the scientific world believe in free will. They can't yet quantify it scientifically but just because you're an atheist doesn't mean the discussion is over.
No because those two babies have different genetics and life experiences.
