Fellas I'm faced with a very big and hard decision rn

You are assuming this person will swipe you back.
The dicks just there so you have something to hold for support. Embrace it (the dick).
You do you bro 
There's a chinese saying that says 不入虎穴,焉得虎子. Cant get the tiger cub without going into the tiger cave. U gotta take risk sometimes in life.
Guys we already matched now idk what to do lol
Look at that booty! Do it
Anytime girl puts her ass on the counter, it’s to make it look bigger, just a heads up! 
What happens when her dick is bigger than yours?
I'm going to share with you a piece of advice I got from 4chan that, while I have never had the opportunity to use myself, I wholeheartedly agree with

> If it's pretty, fuck it. If it's pretty and it has a dick, fuck it in the ass
Dude its better to do it and be super confused the rest of your life than to miss it and be regretful you missed a gourmet experience like this haha
Superlike it, hit it where they least expected
It's 2018, you're gay if you don't suck dick
What the fuck is happening in this thread?
Traps aren’t gay 
Its only gay if the balls touch 
I'm a trans girl.. I'm completely unrecognizable as anything other than female. I'm not like insanely gorgeous, but I'm fairly attractive and get a lot of attention... I don't put it on my tinder profile because there's many people in my life that don't need to know.. But I do tell guys I match with almost right away...

And I'm here to tell you first hand, atleast 80% of guys are into it since they find me attractive otherwise... So yea if you have an attraction, don't feel any sort of way because 8/10 guys would probably do it too. 
Eh, yolo it.
Yo I would hit that no negrets 😤😤😤
The dick only makes it better. Would go with no regrets
I can't tell if these comments are ironic or not 
If you like it, you likes what you likes.
Fool me 17 times, shame on me.
Do it, maybe you learn something about yourself.
No regrates!
Ladyboys were fairly common on Tinder in Bangkok. Also very upfront about it. Never offended when I said no thanks. I figure they know there's plenty of people into it that there's no need for a charade.

That being said it was a train wreck the one time I asked someone who wasn't if she was...


Don't be so vanilla. Tap that ass. 
The dick makes it hotter 
You haven’t lived life until you’ve bumped a ladyboy
I'm ok with this. 
If it helps, it ain't gay
GO FOR IT!
You go suck that cock!
You obviously want to fuck her but just feel conflicted.  Get over that, it's societal bullshit.  Go for it, and have fun.
Mate, you're gonna be faced with a very big and hard knob later.
I have a rule with traps.  Did you trick me? Ima fuck you.
Remember the wise words of general Kenobi, "Spring the trap"
Go for it!
“You sucking?”
I’m pleasantly surprised with how supportive these comments are!
I don’t see the dilemma. If your into that then you are. No big deal go for it.
A decision like Left?
Why does everyone assume she has a dick? She is obviously a bot. 
it's not gay if you don't see the dick.
Holy shit, i looked at the address written on the banner on the first picture and we live at the same city lol
Thicc is thicc, even if they got a dicc!
Then you're prolly gay, so just go for it.
As long as the dicks don’t touch you’re all good bro 
Know what else is big and hard about 'her'?
Don't listen to Reddit on this one. Big no from me.
This thread really shows the average age and maturity level of people on this sub. 

Just treat people with dignity and respect and not like Pornhub category, c’mon guys.
well, shit.


y'all have fun now
Just close your eyes and pretend that this is a vagina
I guess you should change your username to BallChaser 
You can't feel a dick in the dark
First time for everything.
No you don't. It's an easy one. 
It's only gay if your balls touch.
There are no chicks with dicks, just dudes with tits. 
You don't have that username for nothing, do you?
bruh this is 1/2 of BKK tinder. 
Definitely gay dude. Do whatever you want but it's for sure gay to do a man with boob job
No ragrets 
Wait but if Laurence is a TS woman, wouldn’t he/she go by Lauren? O.o
Do it. 

##YOLO
No homo. 
smash
You should change your username to CockChaser
Username isn't checking out for some reason?
You should probably blur out the name, OP
What would be truly epic is if she turned out to be female.
You gotta risk it, for tits
Dude this is such a catfish 
Well Traps are not gay sooo....
Nice, do it.
!RemindMe 1 week
Obviously a spammy account. This same one popped up within 10 miles of me just the other day. And the chances you live in my neighborhood are
No one noticed his user name?
https://youtu.be/gWDUFVYjc1s?t=16s
Ur gay
There are so many smelly countertops on instabook
i want to fuck u int he ass right now
It's a fake profile... If you guys didn't know. 
R/suddenlygay 

I'd smash. No hesitation
Nake sure to keep updating
It might be very hard but don’t flatter yourself by calling it very big 
yolo
The bigger trap can only be if its a fake profile made by your brother/father/coworker/boss.
When in Thailand
Well whatever you choose, it's not gay.
That is definitely a dude's ass
Traps are gay
Tfw you'll never be raped and mindbroken by a cute trap that keeps you as his cockslut forever.

Take this chance man do it for me
Report for being male and move on
It’s not gay if you’re not gay bro.



If you smash you gay 
He isn’t THAT hot though.
What's the decision? If your straight swipe left and if your not swipe right 
Go for it if you're gay, don't if you're straight either way you're fine bud.  
Don't do it, you know it's gay😤
I would like an update, I need to know!!
That’s gay 
everyone saying that it isnt gay but why would it even matter? doing something gay doesnt make you gay. if im straight and suck a dick i wont suddenly prefer dicks over pussies except if i had been gay/bi in the first place. 
I wouldn't judge you and tbh I'd fuck her, him? Her.
sometimes sacrifices must be made OP. At least do it for the good of the team. 
Just drink moonshine 
Yo, is this in colorado? 
Jim Norton, is that you?
There's no such thing as chicks with dicks, just dudes with boobs.
Dude it's ok traps aren't gay
So since this post has gained a lot of traction I will just post this bit. 

HIV and AIDS can be dangerous, but there are options where you can have unprotected sex- which is better- and mitigate the risk of HIV transmission.

Look up your local LGBT resources, health clinics, ect. Ask about PreP. I don't know about the rest of the country, but LA has the LGBT center and offers it very cheap, even free.
What’s the problem?
No balls. Or maybe balls. Don't be a bitch, do it.
Deciding if you're gay/bi or cist? Goodluck!
Nobody is that straight where they would turn this down.
No ones going to say anything about the title? Ok
Orgasms are orgasms
Damn dude
Just turn the lights off and smash my dude 
If you make the wrong one, it wont be the only big and hard thing you have
Ask if they are actually a trap
*Get unmatched immediately*
The real obstacle 
We already matched
That’s what profiles look like after you’ve already matched.
You are assuming this dude person will swipe you back.
Dude it's a trap haha
Just don't let the tips open to receive each other and you're all good 
(the dick) hahahaha 😂 
Jesus christ don't use a dick like a handle. Ouch.
A girl I knew wore a strap on for extra grip 
And maybe them, too.
Even, better let *her*...
You do the bro you 
What’s the end goal there, let’s say you get the tiger cub what do you do with it?
I would say not going in any 穴 won’t give you any 子
Sometimes you gotta risk it to get the biscuit 
Don't mention the trap factor and you're already ahead of 90% of matches. Just drop a ridiculous pick up line off this sub and if you guys get along and bang it out, let us know what you've learned about people and yourself.
1. shes hot as fuck
2. you get to do anal
3. shes gonna suck dick like a pro

suck her dick
go pound that cyborg pussy
Just be chill, don't ask awkward questions or be creepy, treat her like any other woman and just generally be a decent human being :)
Go on a date with her. Worst case scenario is she turns out to not be a good match, but think of what could happen if it goes well.
Why not just be honest about who you are and what you're attracted to in another human being?

If you're cool with the trans factor, great, go have some fun. If not, just say so and move on.

I'd definitely take her out on a date. It's not like you have to go back to her place, right?
Post screenshots lol
Hookup? Worst case scenario you get a piece of premium boy pussy and have to give the lad a reach around.
I don't understand why you're indecisive. You know she has a penis. Are you into that or not? That's the end of the story.
Just treat her with respect and you'll be a-okay. And don't touch her dick unless she wants you to, it can cause dysphoria for most trans girls and probably doesn't work anyway.
Just talk to her
Go out on a date 
Just tell them you are a trap god like Gucci mane
Do it. Live a little try something new

Not like you have to tell all your friends, or anyone ever for that matter
Seems you know what you want to do already
You know what to do, don't be scurd. 
Just go for it. Maybe you're into it maybe you're not. No shame in exloring a little.
Doggy style, obviously.  I'm sure the reach-around is a little different, but otherwise the mechanics should be the same.
Talk to her like you would any other girl. 

Don't even bring it up unless she does.

If you guys click, ask her on a proper date and go have fun. 

If it leads to sex, wear a condom and treat her well.


Just go and have a nice time. It's just a date, I promise you'll both be fine if you just treat it like a date. You might find out you really like her, and that'd be cool. 
Post pics. With her permission of course. 
Just straight up ask it if it’s actually a girl
Ask her if she’s a trap
"Haha I love star wars too!"
I’m with this guy/girl 
Everybody has a hot booty when they do that pose on the counter. I know from experience w my own butt. 
....but that penis tho
She poops with that too lol
[Get in that ass larry](https://youtu.be/CEhk5N32Tec?t=39s)
Look at that dudes booty! Do it FTFY
oh, there will be heads up
> girl
Now you're the girl.

Truly one of my greatest fears.
This needs to be printed on one of those inspirational posters.
Mmm I feel like there are only a couple places they could expect it. 
We're basically becoming Greek people at this point.
It's 2018, you're not cool if haven't had a cock in your mouth  
People who aren't afraid of a little spice in their cooking. 
It's not gay if they have a feminine dick
The dicks makes it better
Exactly, I don't think its gay at all. AT WORST it might be gay adjacent. 
r/animemes is leaking
Ok but how do you explain the semen on your face
OP doe..
Go back to b lol. Nothing against traps but you’re fucking a biological male in his her asshole. If that’s your thing then please keep going on do what you do life is too short to worry about what others thing but still gay is gay. Gay is also okay 
Only bigots wouldn't have sex with a trans person or have any preferences.
Are they a trap if they're transparent about it from the get go though?
Bs
Is only gay if you don´t say "No Homo"
No, but you're gay for liking traps. 
RIP your inbox 
I probably would. And by probably I mean definitely. 
[deleted]
The real question is do they introduce you to their friends and family?
Pics or it didn’t happen 😁
well at least you're honest trap! 
Wait a sec. Is female a gender now or does that still refer to the biological sex?
yes
I’m scared. 
No
Do it for the story OP, you know you wanna
I'm not the OP 
Yeah, didn't realize mainstream subs like this could be so openly racist and transphobic.
Umm, what? Is there something I'm missing here? 
No regerts
Underrated comment
> Tap that ass.

Trap that ass.*
But I haven't bumped anyone chief, ginna be my first time 😂
Can we hear your experience?
Isn't it the exact definition?

>a person who is sexually attracted to people of their own sex.

Note it says sex and not gender.
[removed]
Yea you gonna inspect everyone’s genitals to ensure the proper physiological pronoun is used?
No but I’m not going to encourage someone to believe they’re something they are not. Do you regard the Earth is flat for flat earthers because that is what they believe?

Transgenderism itself is the ultimate endorsement of toxic gender roles. 

A girl is a non-matured human with vagina. 

If you assert there is ANYTHING more to that definition, you are the one cultivating oppressive gender roles.

Doesn’t matter if that person has a beard, doesn’t matter if that person hops on contemporary male fashion band wagons, it doesn’t matter if that person takes it in the ass or that persons name is Jeremy. That person is a girl.

The same set of logic goes with being a boy or a man or a woman. 
And how does this model of penis=male vagene=female fit with intersex people?

Maybe your model needs updating in order to fit with evidence, you know like science..
Probably won't be that big, just saying
I like to think that the whole 'Traps aren't gay' meme brought a positive spin to reddit in regards to transgenderism et cetera.
you mean without hangups and being accepting of trans people? 
But cum on guys is my favorite category
Don't assume our genders. How about you grow up?
This thread is overwhelmingly in support of hooking up with her. You’re delusional. 
How's he gonna do that with a dick in his mouth, Frank?
The real truth
Instead of that, you should drink some nattys and do some fattys
Probably not a catfish because it is in the Philippines. 
did you mean to type  r/suddenlygay ?, I'm a bot beep boop and this action was performed automatically
Lol people are downvoting you for saying the truth (rip my karma)
>genuine advice 

>downvoted to shit

I’ll never understand reddit 
Her, probably.
Exactly. I see it like this. 

Not a big deal, swipe right, in a few weeks you'll probably forget about it anyways and nor have to think about it.
Oh well you made your decision i see.
Case closed. 
Make sure you wear a condom OP.

[Between 22-28% of all transgender women in the US are HIV positive, according to estimates by the CDC.]( https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/transgender/index.html)
Do it
do it.
Enjoy butt stuff then.
Idunbuhleveit
Die it's a trap haha
So your issue is whether to bone the vaginally challenged lady or not?
Shit name checks out. Sadly, it isn’t what you were looking for...
Congratulations!!! When is the ceremony?
OP has big gae confirmed
And if they ever touch just say "no homo" out loud and you're good. 
You get a cool new pet! Of course problems arrive if you get tigered in there.
Eat it. What else?
Then you fuck that cyborg pussy.
Grind up it's claws and snort it as a fertility drug knowing Chinese medicine.
Pet it. 
Where else do you think those tiger balms come from? 
You ain’t wrong
Do you like good listeners?

Because unlike your penis, I'd never cut you off.
>Just drop a ridiculous pick up line off this sub and if you..
#***GUYS*** 

>..get along and bang it out, let us know what you've learned about people and yourself.


>Don’t mention it

The guy posted the profile into reddit. 
Definitely cant argue with this
Why suck dick like a pro? I could understand some serious handjob skills though 
You can't guarantee she's in to anal.  She might just be really in to BJs.  Everyone has their own boundaries. 
Win win 
4. You like dick.
ALL FACTS.
https://media.giphy.com/media/xKy2w6LehxxHa/giphy.gif
I guess it depends on who's paying. 
Ya you're either into it or not. And you're not a bad person of you're not. Just don't be a dick
premium boy pussy...

Ya ok
And that sounds fucking horrific
What's wrong with you people? Or actually idk what's wrong with me? That just seems pretty disgusting as a gut reaction. I wanna believe my gut is right.
So is OP apparently.
I don't.
BB i‘m searching a counter 
Trying this. I'll report back with my findings. (I won't)
No worries. It’s a hot female penis
Careful you don't cut yourself on that edge!
Wat did i just read
Personally I feel like if I ever did hook up with a chick-with-dick I'd just stick to oral, I don't wanna get fucked in the ass so I feel like it wouldn't be fair. My point being, hit that and if anyone ever tries to mock you for her having a dick just say "You wish you could bang a girl as hot as Laurence"
Nope.  Have them bend their leg and fuck 'em behind the knee. So many possibilities!
As a bi dude... what a time to be alive.
Greece fell to Christianity. Modern West will fall to Islam.

Gaycurious.
I mean, masturbation is just homosexual incest so it's at least a little better than that right??
You tell yourself every night it wasn't gay because you didn't get penetrated 
Let OP decide that for themselves.
Welcome to the majority 😅 lol 
Well to each their own but that's not smart on her part... Good for you guys tho lol
Depends on the dynamics of each interaction... Many do not no.. Some do! I've made some amazing friends through tinder matches that invited me to things... My best friend is the cousin of a dude I hooked up with like a year ago lol 
If I don't say I'm trans on my profile, I certainly have no interest of outing myself on a popular reddit page... Nice try tho!! 😊 
Honestly idfk... Maybe that was the wrong wording? I'm transgender myself and still don't completely understand all the terminology 
no
Even better!!! 
Think of the story you will tell the grandkids 
Shit son, fuckin' do it. You get to experience the whole thing differently. Not everyone gets to do anal on their first time

And then eventually you can learn of vaginas and how they're magical. But a trap is fine too
My only advice: USE LUBE

tons of it, but she’ll probably guide you along

Anyways, lube: use it
Its hardly even a question. Make sure to tell her your a virgin.
Great reason to take things slow.  

It's not going to hurt anyone to just go on a date with her and see how you get along.  It's all a moot point if it turns out your personalities don't fit.  
Wait what? I will go against the others and say your first time shouldnt be that. (Or any Tinder date for that matter.) Get a relationship!
DONT FUCKING DO IT DAWG 
At the end of the day the genitals are just one physical feature. A deal breaker for most. But if someone looks 100% like a gorgeous woman, but has a penis, even many straight men would be attracted to them. Straight men who wouldn't otherwise seek out sex with cis men. You can be attracted to cis women *and* be attracted to trans women *and not* be attracted to cis men *and not* be attracted to trans men, I would consider that person straight.
But is it the dick he is attracted to or is it just something extra he is ok with. Like when she has a big nose or something.
Yeah, the folks here are objectifying her just like any other woman, it's remarkably inclusive really, I didn't expect to see it.
Idk
The Romans hated Jesus because he spoke the truth
Yeh apparently lots of "straight" people want to have sex with a dude. 
Now he has to think about it since they already matched lol
We did it Reddit?
Very important point. A lot of people believe it’s transphobic to bring this up, but sexual health is important for everyone. 
Why such a high number? 
I think you mean "make sure she wears one."
I mean, wear a condom anyways though, regardless of who you're sleeping with
i think OP is in the Philippines


How have I never seen this stat before?? That's an staggering percentage. 
She is a transgender?...
That left pic shows she is probably in or from the Philippines, not the US. Still, those statistics are tragic. Nothing wrong w giving someone different a try, but stay safe OP!
You mean make sure he/she wears a condom 
>A 2017 paper used meta-analysis and synthesized national surveys to estimate that 1 million adults in the United States are transgender.

>From 2009 to 2014, 2,351 transgender people were diagnosed with HIV in the United States.

>According to current estimates, around a quarter (22-28%) of transgender women are living with HIV

I'm failing to see how this adds up.  Over the span of 5 years 2,351 (0.2% of the trans population) trans people (not just women, so that number is slightly smaller for trans women) were diagnosed with HIV, yet somehow an estimated (estimated being emphasized here) quarter million trans women are living with HIV?  Just doesn't add up.  
[deleted]
Of course silly me
C'mon guy, be a buddy, pal. Seriously just phrasing.
Not gay if it’s for the memes 
“She” 
insider knowledge about what techniques work best 
You actually know what it feels like when you're doing that stuff with your mouth instead of just guessing.
This guy handjobs
I know that if i were gay I’d give unreal blowjobs. Probably rivalling some of the blowjobs I’ve ever had. Well maybe except for Yuliya...that girl sucked a mean dick for an 18 year old. 
best.reaction.ever
The anal or the handjob?
Not everyone is on the same part of the Kinsey scale as you. Some of us are sort of in the middle. 
Live a little. 
I suggest you go with your gut. A rule of thumb: if you don’t like the idea of having sex with a certain gender, don’t do it.
what, fucking someone with a penis is disgusting?
Which is disgusting, touching a penis or being balls deep in a traps ass ?
Nice.
Ok Brent throw a thong on do the pose and you'll be shocked. In a bad way. Because it'll work. 
That was smooth
Does trap just mean preop trans? Still don't really know under what circumstances that word is used. 
>**female** *penis*

Wtf reddit.
Remember that this cute trap will age and become a big hairy man pounding your ass while you cry in a few years.
Promise?
What ?
PROMISE?
You gotta find out what they're into. Many gay men and trans women prefer to only receive. It is not at all uncommon. 
I can’t wait to stone my gf to death in the future. It’s gonna be lit! 
Nah.

Excuse me, but I'm offended you don't care. Please start caring /s
This opens up so many doors for you!
Ain't gonna be no grandkids, if they hit it off.
I see that point, but physical attraction is only one small part of a relationship. 

If OP is truly heterosexual he might not find fulfillment in a relation like this. It's a pretty complex issue.

> 100%

You keep using that word; I don't think it means what you think it means.

Vulva, vagina, uterus, ovaries, etc., is a large percentage of what defines "woman".
The Romans 73 different words for "buttplug".
I to am getting concerned by the large amount of people that now want to fuck guys while still saying they are straight. It’s a strange sight to behold 
Mission accomplished
Did you ever doubt. 
We found the Boston marathon bomber 
To be fair, you really ought to wrap it up regardless of who it is if you're banging people off Tinder.  Or people in general.
Yea, but fuck mental health.
You are right. It’s probably a more positive message just say: “approximately three out of four transgender women in the US will not give you HIV during sex or shared needles.”
Can you offer an example of someone calling this transphobic? I want to see the asshattery.
Trans woman here. Always protect your sexual health. The high number is from many of trans women needing to have employment and sex work is usually the only job we can find because of hate. 
HIV has a much higher transmission rate through anal than vaginal
Anal sex has much higher risk of HIV transfer than vaginal sex. Even with a condom iirc the condom is more likely to be damaged through anal sex than vaginal sex. So overall that increases the risk for transgender women. 

I don't know if that alone leads to the increased percentage. Might be also skewed higher because the percentage of transwomen 
that engage in more illicit sexual behaviour is higher than in ciswomen.
A lot trans women are cut off from support and have trouble securing jobs historically and today, so many become sex workers. Add that to the higher risk of HIV transfer with anal sex and a higher likelihood of being low-income, and it paints a depressing picture.

If the trans women is an engineer, you're probably fine.
* Easier to catch through receptive anal.
* They get raped a lot more than the average person.
* More likely than the average person to be sex workers (probably because other jobs don't hire them and they need to eat and pay for surgery, or support themselves when family kicks them out) or use injectable drugs (because life sucks so why not).
Having unprotected sex with a woman is actually less risky than protected sex with a gay man. It's not PC to talk about but HIV is really only prevalent because of homosexual sex and IV drug use.
Sex work, the anal thing, and just kinda poor people end up with higher rates of most diseases, and we end up poor a lot
[deleted]
That too, haha!
The rates are probably higher in the Philippines.
The poverty stricken sex worker demographic I assume is somewhat filtered out from your sample of people who are active in a supportive social group.
Thats purely anecdotal.
I'm not your guy buddy!
Yeah and I brought the emphasis.
E D G Y

Y
Yeah, she. Asshole.
Not "she". She.
Super overrated. A sufficiently slutty ciswoman knows what to do just as well.
Hmm 🤔 should all men give blowjobs to take advantage of their advantageous perspective 🤔 
Funny, you should say that to the OP who said "worst case scenario"
Addendum: do try not to classify any sexual attraction you don't feel as "disgusting" and ask people "what is wrong with [them]" because they're into it.
I’m pretty sure my amount of hair precludes any finding of a hot booty. 
It's not gay if its a feminine penis. 
They meant "feminine".

LIFE HAS MANY DOORS ED BOY!
Use often!
Well since they can't get pregnant maybe some people would forget about the health protection effects of a condom
Lol good one 
> Or people in general.

Not with my girlfriend! I already know I gave her my gonorrhea and herpes, so we're good to go baby.
Butt fuck mental health

Yeah fuck my mental up healthilly
Has transitioning been proven to help with the mental health of trans individuals?  I’ve been hearing a lot lately that most people are just as unhappy after transitioning.  What other steps are there to help these people?
What does mental health have to do with anything? 
Just bang your head. Metal health is all you need.
I don't have an example but I would assume its part of the effect that happens when activists martyrize a precedently discriminated group of people, and then take offense at any negative comment about said group despite its factuality or intent.
Gay non-trans men are having just as much anal sex. I'm not sure that's the only reason.
The cdc provides some reasons:

> Multiple factors have put transgender people at risk for HIV infection and transmission, including multiple sexual partners, anal or vaginal sex without condoms or medicines to prevent HIV, injecting hormones or drugs with shared syringes and other drug paraphernalia, commercial sex work, mental health issues, incarceration, homelessness, unemployment, and high levels of substance misuse compared to the general population, as well as violence and lack of family support.

(From the same link I posted.)
bruh what
You forgot to add that there's a lot of pressure not to use condoms since there's zero chance of pregnancy
You had me until your last sentence, and then lost me completely.

Bruh, what? 
There are a lot of transgendered folk in tech for whatever reason. He’s not wrong
A lot of this comes down to social factors. A person with poor access to medical care, little money, etc is more likely to have negative health outcomes affect their life such as HIV. Richer people are healthier, go figure. 
Plus its like 50% chance with a black male. The chances are just insanely high.
Thank you.  It’s trying to create a straw man argument to refute cold hard stats.  
I'm not your buddy, friend!
If he/she has a straight up dick it’s not a “she” bro 
What option on tinder allows you to filter out penis then?
Lol
Serious question, why is it that feeling like an arm on your body doesn’t belong (BIID) is classified as a mental disorder but wanting to for example remove your dick because you identify as a woman is not a mental disorder? 

I legitimately don’t understand I’m not trying to troll, I just see such similarities but apparently one is different 
It's not gay if it's for research.

I've heard the argument that men have less of a gag reflex in general, so that's pretty much a win all around.  
Seems like a good rule. I guess a having a bit of growing to do as a person. I'm not sure if I can not knee jerk reaction to something like scant though. It seems far off and on an extreme.
Child rape,
What is wrong with people into scat play, children, and animals 

We gotta have a line of what’s acceptable sometime guys
As long as it’s consensual and everybody involved is fully capable, get the hell out of their bed. How’s that for a line?
>children, animals

>consensual 

It’s like you can’t read?
My wording was not the best, by fully capable I meant [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competence_(law)#), which obviously excludes the two categories you mentioned. 
Ok y'all win. I didn't think about that lmao. I was more thinking about the shape that pose does for a booty 😂😂
Penis is a penis dawg. Is okay to be gay, just call it what it is.

Research Findings

1. The scholarly literature makes clear that gender transition is effective in treating gender dysphoria and can significantly improve the well-being of transgender individuals.

2. Among the positive outcomes of gender transition and related medical treatments for transgender individuals are improved quality of life, greater relationship satisfaction, higher self-esteem and confidence, and reductions in anxiety, depression, suicidality, and substance use.

3. The positive impact of gender transition on transgender well-being has grown considerably in recent years, as both surgical techniques and social support have improved.

4. Regrets following gender transition are extremely rare and have become even rarer as both surgical techniques and social support have improved. Pooling data from numerous studies demonstrates a regret rate ranging from .3 percent to 3.8 percent. Regrets are most likely to result from a lack of social support after transition or poor surgical outcomes using older techniques.

5. Factors that are predictive of success in the treatment of gender dysphoria include adequate preparation and mental health support prior to treatment, proper follow-up care from knowledgeable providers, consistent family and social support, and high-quality surgical outcomes (when surgery is involved).

6. Transgender individuals, particularly those who cannot access treatment for gender dysphoria or who encounter unsupportive social environments, are more likely than the general population to experience health challenges such as depression, anxiety, suicidality and minority stress. While gender transition can mitigate these challenges, the health and well-being of transgender people can be harmed by stigmatizing and discriminatory treatment.

7. An inherent limitation in the field of transgender health research is that it is difficult to conduct prospective studies or randomized control trials of treatments for gender dysphoria because of the individualized nature of treatment, the varying and unequal circumstances of population members, the small size of the known transgender population, and the ethical issues involved in withholding an effective treatment from those who need it.

8. Transgender outcomes research is still evolving and has been limited by the historical stigma against conducting research in this field. More research is needed to adequately characterize and address the needs of the transgender population.

Well from my perspective transitioning has played a huge role in helping my mental health. But we have to put in work too. Many see transition as a magic fix, but it is only a knob to turn down the stress. Not get rid of it. We need to work to find happiness it's not going to come in a bottle.

Also there are a ton of society pressures and hate that effect our mental health, so once people treat us like humans then we will see a rise in trans mental health. 
Suicide rates stay consistent post transition, and quite a number of people experience regret after having surgery. 
Yes, it has 
Trans people have a suicide rate that's a few hundred times higher than the national average.

So, no, it does not help them.

The suicide rate for those that fully transition (aka, cutting off their dick) is close to 50%. 
I've just seen this statistic bandied about as a way to other transgender folks. I don't see other demographics get that treatment, but that's likely due to how trans people are still treated as niche, despite growing numbers and acceptance. 

I'm not saying it's not a fact, just that it's been used negatively in my experience and I instinctually treat it as such. 
Which is why HIV is a larger issue in the gay community than straight. The topic didn't mention gay non-trans men
I might be banned for "transphobia" or whatever but I'm sure there is a concomitant increase in mental illness prevalence that predisposes to increased unsafe sexual behavior rates and thus prevalence of STD's.  
Another word for "non-trans" is cisgender, or just cis. The more you know!
lol they just listed every possible reason someone could be more likely to be HIV+. Smart move cdc, smart move. 
Let's break it down for you.

Sex workers have a high rate of HIV. Anal sex has a higher transmission rate for HIV. It would follow that trans women who are sex workers would have a high rate of HIV.

Trans women who are not sex workers are just as likely as any gay man, assuming the same level of promiscuity, to have HIV.
What no way 50% of black males are spreading around hiv
Well I'm not your friend, pal!
Look, I'll admit that I find the whole concept of being transgender strange, but if she identifies as a girl then refer to her as a girl. 

Even if you disagree with being transgender, what the fuck do you gain by calling her a boy when that is not what she identifies as? The only thing you are accomplishing is looking like a dickhead.
If you're sexually attracted to a person who looks like a woman and you think is a woman but you find out has a penis, does that make you gay?

EDIT: Respond instead of downvoting me :(
No such thing as chicks with dicks, just dudes with boobs.
So how does you being a pussy help you identify as "he"? Bro
There are no chicks with dicks Johnny, only guys with tits. 
Think you need to deal with the marginal instances case by case by sorting by gender. The other option is you have to filter all genitalia by being you.
I think if you were just like "I need to rip off my dick" it would be. As opposed to feeling like you are the opposite sex.
it is a mental disorder, dumbass.  its gender dysphoria and before you get a gender swap operation you have to have doctors sign off saying you have it. 

jesus... 
The difference lies in the fact that it’s not the identifying as a woman that is causing significant distress or disability in trans women, but the gender dysphoria that results from the mismatch between their bodies and what feels right and natural. If a cis man were to start to transition in the same manner that a trans women would, they would likely feel gender dysphoria (despite being cis), because their newly feminine body would feel wrong in a similar way to a pre-transition trans person

See [this](http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx) for more info, under the “Is being transgender a mental disorder?” tab, a little down the page

tldr: it’s not identifying a certain way that is debilitating, but the mismatch between that and one’s body, which can be remedied through transition
Brojob
Need a study buddy, bro?
Meta 
I've got a pretty bad gag reflex, but only when it comes to food and medication. For some reason dick doesn't really trigger it.
I think there’s a pretty blatant line between non-harmful sexual behaviour/preferences (like having sex with a trans woman) and pedophilia/rape lmao. It’s obviously fine to be openly disgusted by rape, but it’s incredibly rude to express disgust towards sexual behaviour because it isn't bone straight.
If the balls don't touch then technically it's still heterosexual intercourse. 
Depends if you get that far with a tarp
Head On! 
Please tell it's this one and not the other one
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Sacred_Theology
Very interesting and very fast thank you!  This  looks like a lot of the other stuff I’ve read where the conclusions are not definitive, but they are certainly positive. I’m sure we will get there with time though, the more research we conduct the quicker we will find the answers.  Funding for this type of research has increased dramatically along with awareness of gender dysphoria in recent years.  

The long term effectiveness is really what I’m interested in.  Lots of treatments work short term but can be detrimental over long periods of time (ie benzodiazepines).  It’s just too soon to really know 
>4. Regrets following gender transition are extremely rare

Is there an age range for this? I know there's a lot of controversy about this with children and young adults and whether they actually have gender dysphoria or if they're just being children.
That makes sense.  For me my depression gets extremely bad when I isolate from people, and a big component of that has been pure laziness.  If I’m isolated and not trying to change my situation, shit gets really bad (and has often resulted in substance abuse).  I could see for someone with dysphoria that a transition would give them that boost to get on with life again. Kind of how medications can drastically improve people’s lives by giving them an edge.  

From my point of view it seems an extreme treatment.  But I also think giving adderall to kids under 12 is very extreme.  I don’t have any moral issue with it (I love adderall haha) I just find it to be too extreme a treatment in most cases for children with ADHD.  

It definitely seems like most data coming out with transitioning is a net positive.  
Where are you getting your information?
Could you provide a source for that claim please?
Isn’t surgery super expensive too?  Like I wonder if getting a higher quality of therapeutic care and cognitive behavior training would improve their outcomes.  Like if the $20,000 (or whatever it costs) was invested into the purely mental health side of things.

I fully support people transitioning or doing whatever the fuck they want to their bodies, like 100% I think it’s great.  But I find a physical surgery as treatment for mental issues to be a little bit extreme.  If anything I just need to see some data on it’s efficacy to convince me.  It’ll be interesting to see what those data look like as the years roll on and the treatment becomes more popular.
That's just not true, I don't know why you feel the need to lie about something like this.
Is this an issue with a person's initial mental health or a consequence of how many of these people are being treated?  I'd probably have worse mental health if I had to deal with some of the shit I've seen local people who are trans deal with.
This has been debunked countless times.  Go fuck yourself.
Any evidence to support this assertion because the other reply contradicts you and provides sources
 *This is completely untrue. * Suicide rates drop after transition and very few people regret it. In fact, Sam Kane, the most famous "regret case" who made it a popular notion that trans people would change their minds, said they were lying to themselves and re-transitioned.

There have been multiple studies that have been deliberately misrepresented, the most common of which is this, headed by Cecilia Dhejine:

http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885

What's interesting about this is that the study concludes that there is a higher incidence of suicide and suicide attempts in the post op transgender population compared to background. Many people have misunderstood this or have been misrepresented as to this being a comparison between pre and post op trans people, where it is not -- it's a comparison between post of trans people and non trans people. The author was so upset with the misrepresentations she gave an interview with  transadvocate trying to explain what her research actually was testing and concluding:

http://transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm

Trans people regret surgery at about the same rate people regret gastric bypass surgery. 
Every (nonpolitical, science-based) medical organization, nationally and internationally, supports medically and/or surgically transitioning (depending on what's best for the patient) as treatment for gender dysphoria -- if it was so ineffective as to increase rates of suicide pre vs post op, this would not be the gold standard of gender dysphoria treatment. It works: access to these transition tools reduces suicide by in between 60 to 80% in trans populations.

[removed]
This is a lie. Roughly 0.5% experience regret which is very much in line with any other major medical procedure. There are many barriers in place to prevent people from getting surgery. No one "accidentally" changes their sexual organs. It's a multi year process that costs most people more money than they make in an entire year. If someone has SRS, it's safe to say that they wanted it and they are extremely unlikely to regret it.

 Post surgical outcomes are generally positive and any study will back me up. And the study you're about to quote I'm guessing you didn't read and then I'll have to explain why you misinterpreted what they said.

Ive done this song and dance many times.

If I had to guess, the "study" you read said that post SRS patients still have depression and suicide outcomes greater than the general population. What you didn't read was that this was for the pre 1975 cohort and that post 1975, post surgery outcomes are similar to the general population. What you also didn't take into account that greater than the general population doesn't mean greater than individuals that didn't have SRS. No literature supports the statement that SRS worsens or does not improve transgender mental health.
>  I don't see other demographics get that treatment


Men who have sex with men are prohibited from donating blood in the US due to the higher than average level of HIV.
Oh definitely. Facts can be used to hurt progress, especially when it comes to discrimination. In my opinion, the important thing is that facts are presented in context, so that, in this case for example, you can decouple the high rates of HIV from being an inherent trait of transgendered people.
Right, but that statistic isn't the same in the gay vs trans community. 1/4 of gay men aren't HIV positive. But I'm certainly open to hearing why I may be mistaken.
There is a study about the effects of depression on sexual risk reduction. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2767174/)

Since depression and other mental health issues are more common in transgender individuals (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261762967_An_Overview_of_Depression_among_Transgender_Women), your comment seems to make sense
You're probably right. And the "you can't say anything negative about trans people" thing is why I didn't offer other, more reasonable explanations as well.
Not true. They didnt say anything about getting it from a toilet seat
To be honest I thought a trap was a guy that likes dressing as a girl similar to a cross dresser, and a trans is someone that’s actually trans lol 
Does that really apply to a site where the pronouns he and she are pretty important to it's purpose. Putting your dick  in something.
Pronouns exist for communicating my perceptions, not for others to bully me for not buying into their interior lives. 
It’s not gay if you’re not gay
no
Imo it depends. If you like and view the person as a woman before you know the person has a dick then no. But if you find out and then continue feeling the same, then yeah you gay 

P.S. I never downvote on Reddit lol, I was in an interview and couldn’t really open this thread at the workplace 😂
Its not gay unless its two people of the same gender. If fucking a girl with a dick is gay, solo masturbation is 100% gayer.
If the girl presents and identifies as a lady, you're fucking a lady with the unfortunate medical condition of having a dick.  I have straight male friends who have dated trans women and that was how they described the experience.  It'd be like sex with anyone else who has an issue with the functionality of their genitals, like a woman with vaginismus or vulvodynia (both vaginal pain conditions that make vaginal sex difficult if not impossible).  You don't have to put your fear of dicks on everyone else. Some people don't care as much as you.
My fear of dicks? I have no issue with people that do it, go for it if you want. But don’t be surprised when I think you’re gay (nothing wrong with it) cause you’re having sex with someone that has a penis lol 

also the "unfortunate medical condition" you describe is straight biology. imo the unfortunate condition they have is a mental disorder that makes them believe they are a different gender :/ similar to how people with BIID believe one of their limbs is not their own. 
Are you serious? If you are, do her a favor and make yourself sound like the complete ass you are, so she knows not to waste her time.

Personally, I hope you're not as ignorant as you sound. 
The truth
Username checks out
But they aren’t like “I need to rip off my arm” they legitimately feel like the body part in question is not “them.” Like it’s a foreign body part or something 
Yeah, I knew the OP probably meant that, was just making an off-color joke.
Apply directly to the forehead.
Check out the comment above this, that Cornell review of the available literature directly contradicts what this person is saying.  Transitioning improves the mental health of transgender individuals in almost every case, and surgery is a large part of that process for many people.

Actually neither bc what he said is a lie.
you pre op, or post op?
you intentionally act like an idiot, or just plain stupid?
Answer the question.
This is an excellent back and forth.  Don't worry about sources lol.  
I'd like to see your source because, and I know this sounds dumb, but ten minutes of googling kinda says otherwise 
Which has very little basis in reality as well. I guess I should say, queer folks in general get this othering treatment.
> Which has very little basis in reality as well.


Liar.
Yeah, no. 
I just feel like... In this case, per se, if he were hooking up with a cis girl no one would've mentioned this sort of statistic. It's directly linked, thus, to the person's gender identity and can't be easily compartmentalized as such.
Close to 1/4 actually. https://www.hrc.org/resources/hrc-issue-brief-hiv-aids-and-the-lgbt-community.  1 in 6 overall. 1 in 4 Hispanic. 1 in 2 African American. 
Say what ever you want. Overly fanatical left people are just as bad as the overly fanatical right scum. 
"trap" isn't a well defined term
I understand where that could get confusing - not sure I fully I understand it either - but as far as my understanding of it is, you can be a trap i.e. crossdresser while still identifying as a man, but in this case she's called herself a woman which means she's transgender. 

Transgender =/= transsexual.
Originally, that's what it meant, but the trans community has kind of adopted that term. The way I see it, most transwomen would never intentionally hide that information from a partner to trap them, that would be pretty shitty to do. However, being feminine enough that someone would be "tricked" into believing you are cis would basically be the goal of transitioning in the first place.
I thought a trap is a hot/super-hot tg girl
The term "trap" came into use because for some reason, straight dudes assumed that a trans person presenting as female was doing so for the purpose of playing a mean trick on them, rather than because that's how the woman actually identified.  Leave it up to straight dudes to assume someone's entire life is actually all about them. 
Well maybe if the operations and hormones weren't so fucking expensive, the gender labels would line up better for everyone's convenience.
Would you really feel that gay banging an ass like that?
Well yes....
If you don't want to, don't. It's fairly clear in this case, even if you call her 'she'.
If you want to call a trans woman a he, no one is going to stop you. Nobody can do anything to stop you. But just consider that you may be hurting someone's feelings, and causing emotional distress to someone. And if you do that regardless, many will reserve the right to call you a dick, because you're doing for no reason. Someone who with full knowledge causes emotional distress to another is a dick in my book. But like I said, there's nothing that I, or anyone else, can do to stop you. It's in you, to decide what kind of person you want to be. 
Literally the only right answer here.
^ If you jack off you're gay because a man gave you a handjob and then you came all over yourself. /s
Well its nice to see the man of la manche has some sensibility.
Not everybody wants to fuck former boys
^this
Head on!
There is regret for some people, but "quite a number" isn't really a solid claim to begin with.  People who are post-transition commit suicide at higher rates than the rest of society, but there doesn't look to be a study comparing suicide rates pre- and post-transition.


Added a few
Here ya go :)
Interesting. Well 1 in 6 overall is stastically quite a bit less than 1/4.
And in many circles is considered a pejorative and insulting. Obviously not OP's match, but I'd always be careful using it.
looks like a duck, acts like a duck. 
The study specifically says the suicide rate was higher than the general population. NOT higher than people who did not have surgery. This statistic is also for the pre 1975 cohort. Post 1975 is similar to general population.

In other words. Sex reassignment surgery improves outcomes.
