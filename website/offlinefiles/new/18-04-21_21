Medical gloves designed for medical emergency response.

No company will ever purchase these - $19.99 for one box compared to $4.99 to $8.99 for medical grade gloves .  That’s not including a bulk discount. 

Just looked at the website and amazon again- and it gets worse. There are only 50 pair (100) gloves in these and in the normal medical glove boxes there are 100 pair (200). Geez.

Most responders I've ever encountered, which is loads in 15 years of ambulance work, just write on the glove anyway. Why pay extra for printed gloves? 
Personally, I don't see a point in these. I am constantly changing my gloves because I do not want to contaminate anything. My vitals that I wrote down would be lost somewhere in the abyss of on scene
Looks like GallowBoob beat you to the repost by about 25 minutes.  Keep trying, though!
It’s cool as long as there is no vomit/ blood...
"Hey, what were his readings again?"

"Oh shit, hold on... I need to get get my gloves out of the trash"
Is this the new Fitbit? I bet they charge like 200$ for it. 

This person is left handed.
Patient seems to be okay with this vitals.
Perhaps the silliest way to pry money out of the indigent EMTs wallet I’ve seen in quite some time....
I created an account just to say how dumb these are.  Nobody thinks these are useful beyond a green EMT/Paramedic/ER staff member.  Absolute waste of money.

Just write on your normal glove.  Differentiate O2 vs Heart rate by drawing a tiny heart after the HR or % sign after the O2 sat.  Seriously.  These are dumb.
Or, just write on 3" silk that you tape to your leg.
The RR is 18? Of course it is. 
ITT: Non-EMT try to tell EMTs how to do their job
First item is GCS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale
Worked as a unit, ED, and OR nurse these are completely pointless- no one needs to pay extra for little spots that are labeled. Its just gimmicky. Anyone working in medicine would be able to read a list of vitals without it being labeled- maybe the coma score could be mix up with resp rate so just either throw in an RR or GCS  note yourself to denote the difference. 
Hey these are just like the vital info notepads I bought when I started EMT school that never used and recently threw away
This is a shining example of the kind of thing my manager (who hasn't worked a nursing shift in 10 years) would think is just sooooo awesome and useful and will order 500 boxes of them instead of the new hoyer lift we asked for....
Looks cool until it gets covered in bodily fluids. I just place a strip of Medical tape on my leg and write on that if I have nothing else handy.
Yo I got a whole wall on my ambulance that’s a white board. If I got something my monitor doesn’t register and record, I’ll write it there lol. 
Nobody at my station would ever use these
Wearing these in EMS would be equivalent to wearing an "I'm a Trainee" badge. 
Worked three years as a paramedic while in college. I would question the intelligence of any medical director that signed their system up to buy these. What a dumb gimmick. 
Paramedic here. Never going to use these. For one, I get free gloves from the hospital. Two, not going to leave patient information laying around, and last but not least, I change my gloves way to often for each patient to make these useful. Writing the info down on a note card or two inch tape does the same thing better. 
I usually throw mine away before leaving the scene so that wouldn't help me much.
And look- they've still written elsewhere on the glove. 
What happens is you write vitals down and then throw the glove away.

“.... fuck.”

*tries to remember virals*
Love the odd number in the bp.
\*Hands the admitting nurse a shit- and blood-soaked ball of nitrile\*  
Here’s his details
This is dumb af. People change their gloves many times during a trauma case. I'd just write on the patient tbh
Well, okay... but it seems like a waste of time putting those on a patient when seconds matter. 
These remind me of a project I worked on in high school. I was in an advanced graphics class that did all sorts of jobs for the community, chiefly screen printing. 

Towards the end of the year, we had a guy come in and ask for disposable triage assessment boards. He wanted them to be cheap to manufacture and easy to attach/clip to a patient after an emergency. He also didn’t want to pay for a different machine, like something that was used for these gloves, as he only had a screen print setup. We tried a dozen different inks made for printing on plastic, at least six different substrates, we tried different squeegees, any variable you can think of, we tried it. Hours of experimenting later, we finally came upon a combination that worked. 

I’m not in the medical field, so I don’t know if he ever did anything with the product, but I imagine they ended up like these gloves. A nice idea, but ultimately just a waste of ink. 
We can go one step further. Wearable IOT medical kit. Trick is manufacturing resistive technology together with WI-FI to cloud. I know of one company doing this, we just await authority funding. It would revolutionise the NHS
Where can one purchase these? I have a niece who’s EMT and Im sure she’d love these!!!
Each blood type should have a symbol that is tattooed at everyone's shoulder in some point of life
How do you get them on the patient's hand?
or just write bcde on before you get to the incident
This was hard to look at bc the user is left handed.
When you handle ethanol based desinfectants the info might be lost
R/specializedtools
r/specializedtools
Man if the victim is wounded, blood would cover that in like 30 seconds. Great for medical issues like stroke etc though. 
How would you even keep the recorded data if you do the flippy thing when you take your gloves off?
And what if you are not lefthanded?
I need these for chemistry
Why so expensive??? Maximum price for glows must be 0,50$!!!
Are you the new u/GallowBoob?
Yeah those were ok when he a box of them but I think they ran out in a few hours and then the company didn’t want to buy anymore.
They used to use napkins at the hospital near where I went to school. This is definitely an improvement.
I just use a piece of paper
These would be extremely *handy*
When I grab gloves from a box I dont want to care which glove is right and which is left.
This reminds me of the condom fair at Greendale where printing on the condoms made them leak. 
Do you normally use gloves for one time use especially for medical purpose? Also, is it possible to wash them? 
And here.. we.. go..
We almost always had a bunch of stickers with the patient's name and medical record number on them when we went in to see the patient. We'd just write that info on the extra stickers and tuck it into our pocket. It was very helpful if you had to see more than one patient in a short period of time.
Useless. I’m right handed.
Been working in EMS for over 10 years. Great gimmick. Have yet to see these in the field. never wrote on the back of my hand like this. Always the meat between the thumb and forefinger.  Not to mention the price. No Thanks. 
First responder- no thank you.  The extra person with the clip board and clean hands can take these stats. Or I can remember 6 numbers...... don't want to risk putting a pen through my glove. Or dirtying a pen 
A medical marker must be attached to the glove.
What is GCS?
Only for the left-handed. 

Weird
What is gcs?
/r/mildlyinterestingatbest
Usually in an emergency setting you write on anything BUT your gloves (you change them so frequently when soiled with fluids.) Piece of paper towel is usually my go to. Anytime there is a code blue/RRT, I just grab a piece near the sink and start writing (of course the real information is added to the EHR when able) Hands, bed sheets, silk tape on your pants also work.
Works great until you have to gingerly take off your gloves to not lose the information or walk around with dirty gloves
Nice but not practical. 
Left handed burn them. 
Of course, this is a good thing, but I think this is just another marketing move.
How are these for an emergency response? They’re just labeled for vitals...
[deleted]
Until you accidentally throw them away and lose the vitals. 
r/specializedtools
Cool in theory but not very useful irl. If we desperately need to write things down, we just write it on our scrubs. 
I slap a three wide "pad" of med tape on my right thigh. All my info gets noted there and I can peel it off and hand it off to someone else. (back of your hand is a way smaller writing space and it would suck to be handed report on a bloody/shitty glove) 
He writes with his left hand well
May be useful for EMS. As a CVICU nurse I would use these zero times. 
Please don't do this. You're picking up a pen with a dirty gloved hand to write on a dirty gloves and then your probably going to never want that pen in between patients. Not to mention if you remove your gloves correctly they will be inside out. 
I'm allergic to ink, I'm suing
this seems totally pointless and stupid. can someone enlighten me on why you need to write on your gloves? doesn't writing on them contaminate them?
what about accidently piercing your glove with the pen, defeats the purpose of a glove.
Not sure what this solves 
What is cool idea they wouldn't have to write on their hands anymore!
The lines are horizontally aligned with the **middle** of the icons, for God's sake! Is his RR 18 or 98?

What monster created these?

/r/crappydesign
No graphic for SpO2. I vote for a depiction of the RBC chloride shift. 
Tape on scrubs.
This is just stupid. In a case where your patient is stable, for example flu like symptoms, sore knee, nausea, etc you will have more than enough time to input vitals into whatever tablet or software you're using for patient care reports. There is no need to write it down on your glove (which you should take off before handling your tablet/laptop anyways). In critical patients especially, but not exclusively, you should always verbalize the vitals to the rest of your crew anyways so that not only everyone knows, but so that if one or two vitals slip your mind there is someone who can hopefully remind you. 
Been in EMS in the field for over 10 years and classes always tell you to never write on your gloves. You take your gloves off and that info disappears. Maybe it’s different in the clinical setting and you don’t change gloves as much? I don’t know, this just teaches bad habits IMO. 
I’d be the person to put the glove on wrong and have to either just leave it or take it off and put it on correctly 
I do this with my oil change gloves, write down the mileage for the new sticker, the oil filter number if im not familiar with it and the type of oil sometimes too.
That is really cool.
This is all good and well till you accidentally take em off and throw em in the trash. 
Would you really take the time to put a stroke through the fields you are not using?
In a situation where this would be a neat thing, you wouldnt want those gloves touching *anything*, and you certainly wouldnt be saving them to keep the info.  

Shit gets dirty, yo.

This is the medical equivalent of r/mallninjashit
I'm sure the hospital/ambulance charges the patient $1000 for them. 

I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

I hope they make one for us right-handers.
Still has the standard 18 respirations lol
Do you think they come with the RR pre-printed?
Heart Rate: Idle.

He's dead, Jim.
That patient has tachycardia, but BP WNL.
Yeah, lefties!
You won’t be able to see shit with all the blood
Left handed first responders?  No thank you!
Do they come with a sterilized pen? Or do you just grab one from the cup of pens at the nurses station?
r/productporn
Interesting to jerk off with 
This is dumb. Better write the GCS down incase I forget! Duuuuuuuuumb 
Lol i thought the RR was 98 
Cool idea. 
Ahhh technological advancement in medicine...

Sometimes I go to the doctor and it takes longer for him to type my script on the computer, with 1 finger, than the time I was waiting to see him.

I actually know a brain surgeon who only takes referrals via fax - none via scanned docs & email...
Would have been useful years ago. Now our monitor Bluetooths the vitals to our tablet where the report is written then uploaded to the cloud where the hospital pulls it down before we walk in the doors. 
Yes! It beats writing vitals on your skin 
You spelt triage wrong
What about urine output?
1) those vitals are perfect

2) during medical emergencies (codes or rapid responses) one person's task is literally note taker. Most rooms have white boards they record on, or clipboards. This is everywhere.

3) I still kinda want those gloves, but really they are probably going to be dirty. So then you have to take your dirty glove to the computer and chart. 
That is both cool and well done. Yes. Make this a thing.
They are missing number of shocks and drugs administered also. Ive watched enough fly on the wall ambulance shows to know they always mention to the doctors those two things when bringing in a patient.
I can’t believe this isn’t the standard. When we’re these developed? Man creates iPhone then finally finds a way to print on gloves to save lives....
Blood pressure is a little high 
Can someone explain the purpose of these, I can't pick it up from the comments. Are the medical staff writing their own vitals on it?
It already fails a little because It takes 3 sets of measurements to establish a baseline with a patient. What's normal for one person may not be normal for another 
Ink on a glove can't be healthy during an operation. Also gloves need to be switched out often
They actually file these away 
That's also pretty impractical and unhygienic storing gloves that have been used
He's kidding lmao
These aren't sterile gloves. They wouldn't be used during surgery.
That’s crazy clever


not really. people already do it. This just adds the expense of printing on gloves.
And you can just write on your current gloves, which many workers already do. 
They could just throw another line item on the bill:

Emergency Response Gloves - 3 pair - $400
...we just write on the regular ones anyway just the same

If shit is really hitting the fan you have a scribe so you can just work and not worry about it
I was just telling my wife, hey these are cool, now I'm going to go into the comments and find out why pros don't really use these. 
The only way I would see companies buying these if they need to inflate purchases to charge an insurance company it the government more money or something.
Nothing will replace a dry erase marker and the door window 
Not sure if they print on both sides.  Having a lefty and righty would drive the cost up even more.
They cost four times more for a bit of ink? Daaaamnnn 
But they will charge the patients $ 50 for the $4.99.
Also you have to live in constant fear that the HIPAA police will come out of nowhere and chop your hand off. 

Edit: Read [this] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke) 
Came to say this. 
normal boxes are 100 gloves also.
So! The reason you don't ever do this is if you have a messy case, and trust me they come, all your vitals go poof! Those who rely on this cant work in the emergency dpt. Nor in an ambulance
Well I was excited =[
You're contradicting your point by saying it doesn't include bulk pricing. Maybe the bulk discount makes them 4.99 each...
Not only that but most nurses will try to use a pen instead of a marker and will rip the glove. Who violates PPE most? Answer the medical team.  . .  I hate my job.
which is just greed killing an opportunity to gain market share

the cost to make these gloves is identical to the cost of making regular gloves + lets say 25 cents per box for printing.

if they sold these for the same price as the regular gloves and charged the difference in production cost, they could quickly gain market share, as people would switch over to the new product since 25 cents is worth the upgrade.




Source on the pricing? Why would a simple print on these gloves quadruple the price?
How many in a box? Cause as a cop, a box could last me like 5 years if I only used em for medicals, and they would be super convenient 
> No company will ever purchase these 

a hospital might, when they can charge $700 for a pair
What happens if you are right handed?
And unless they come out with gloves for right handed and left handeds, the righties will be writing upside down, looks that way
Also, I'm not left handed
Do they make them for right-handed people as well?
>and in the normal medical glove boxes there are 100 pair (200).

As someone who buys gloves nearly every single day at work, that's not true at all. Some have 50 pairs, some have 65 pairs, some have 75 pairs, some have 100 pairs - it all depends on what you're buying. 
Yeah, I think I already use the prototype of these at work: they’re called every pair of gloves you wear.
It’s an expensive solution to a problem that does not exist
I work in medical sales, hopefully I can help explain how this actually works. 

Any pricing you see on their website or Amazon is not the pricing end users in the hospital / physician office market would see. They get special pricing through distributors and GPO contracts. What you may see listed as 19.99 for a box online could end up in the $3-$6 range per box. 

So if this company is serious about doing business in the Emergency Department, they’ll need to work through a distributor or get on a GPO. Their pricing outside of that realm is irrelevant to their capacity to do business in the space they’re interested in. 

A good example of this is diapers. You go to the store, a pack of diapers can be like $12. They sell diapers to hospitals for less than a penny each. 
Hello, CEO here, just bought these to spite you
Is there any concern that writing on your gloves would rip them?
Also I'm writing these numbers several times. Imagine if you had to double glove...


I was about to say. Bet that’s shits expensive lol it’s not practical. 
Where did you see that price?
source on your claim?

Also, it could be argued they would constitute patient medical information and thus their handling and disposal falls under HIPPA regulations?
HIPAA is regarding patient information that can identify a patient. Vitals can't identify a patient
All zeros identifies the dead patient 
It cannot. This is not a HIPAA violation.
I feel like most people would never use these as intended anyway. It’s nice to write on your gloves until you get blood or vomit on them and have to throw them away and get a new pair. Which is... frequent.  
Because organization is wonderful
Lessen the chance for mistake
Oh. So I guess there's no concern about glove integrity? I would have thought that the pen might tear or puncture the glove. But it looks like everyone does this.
Plus the box of gloves are expensive. No hospital is gonna purchase those.
Probably for newbies who are still trying to remember what to take down so they don’t miss anything. It’s easy to remember to go through the motions and take HR BP and all that good stuff, but forget to write it down and now you’ve forgotten. 
Which is why I never understood why people wrote them on their gloves in the first place. Someone should be responsible for notations alone. 
Also in a true emergency the vitals change constantly. In the field, knowing 5-minute old data doesn’t do much.  In the facility, nearly all that info is already available on the machines next to the bed. 
My professor told us we should write them on the patients sheets
You leave your gloves on scene? Yuck. If you mean the ambulance ok, but on scene? I suggest you don't do that, especially if the scene could be investigated by PD. 
Bad calls the gloves can be left anywhere. But they still get lost in translation.
Yeah, but gallowboob’s title has a spelling error. So this post had a chance. 
How, can anyone tell me how the fuck is not banned?      
He breaks subreddits rules every fucking day.   I'm getting sick of seeing all might power mods doing whatever they want.
I blocked gallowboob and Reddit got more fun for me
Are people really that eager to get karma?
I really try not to touch MY things when I have gloves on. 
And turn them out, because nobody takes powder free nitrile exam gloves off without turning them inside out
I can't believe they would allow southpaws to serve in such a critical role.
No she's not.  As a handwriting expert, I can tell you with 99% certainty that the person who wrote those numbers is right handed.
But I’m sure they are 10/10 pain. 
Bit tachy but otherwise ok. 
Did you just assume haemodynamic stability from haemodynadmic normality!?!
An EMT that buys their own gloves is pretty silly in itself. 
username checks out
what gets me is that over 20,000 people thought they were a cool idea even though the comments clearly show why these aren't worth the cost.
I don't get this. You say "these are dumb" and then continue to say that you would use your glove exactly like that by just drawing it on. Clearly these have a use then. Is it just that they're overpriced?
It's like having a wallet that says 'money goes here, card goes here'. It's stupid and we don't need them.
>Or, just write on 3" silk that you tape to your leg.

That's my jam
When I have to get scrubs from work I always end up with pairs that have been written on by anaethetists. I don't know what fuckin pens they're using but that shit doesn't wash out so I'll be walking round with a blurred set of vitals on my leg all day. 

The linen room women are like gatekeepers and refuse to throw them away or give you another pair if you don't want ones with doodles on 🙄
https://i.redd.it/6xgn4jyno05z.png
My thoughts exactly 
Oh that's EMS 101.
Step one: become taxi driver.

Step two: now you're a paramedic. 
Thanks.
First item is also pretty far down the priority list when dealing with emergency patients :)
Not really 
Hahaha what? That's not true at all
They shouldn’t be writing their GCS as like that anyway. It’s ok to do when it’s 15 but if you say GVS is 9 no one’s going to know what state your patient is in. 
[deleted]
Nobody SHOULD use these.  You don't need a template.  Just write on the damn things.
These are for the guy that buys his own equipment and always carries a laryngoscope with ETT and a tourniquet in his cargo shorts pocket when off duty. 
Vitals machines record in odd numbers.
Hey that's a good idea actually, would keep things a bit more organised if there are alot of patients.  I'll remember that
It's a very kind idea to buy this for your niece, and if it's meant as a nice gift then I would absolutely recommend you go for it.

However, I just want to let you know that the impact of the gift will be mostly symbolic.  Unlabeled gloves are more than enough for EMTs/nurses.

That said, I wish I had an aunt/uncle like you.
If you really want to get her something she'll use, get her some of those pens that also have a stylus tip. We use these on the ambulance all the time for our touch screen laptops (that's what most EMS companies use for patient documentation) and we're notorious for losing them
I googled "medical gloves write".  Readyglove was what popped up.
did you mean to type  r/specializedtools ?, I'm a bot beep boop and this action was performed automatically
They're disposable. And no. 
Glasgow coma scale 
Vitals are critically important for emergency response. Is their heart beating? Are they breathing? Is their blood pressure and O2 sufficient to perfuse their vital organs such as brain and heart?
15 means a fully awake person, it's the highest score on the scale. For GCS higher is better.
That's a normal heart rate, sure it's suppose to "be" 60-100. 106 indicates literally nothing. And 128 is a little high for systolic but indicates nothing either
No.
This is exactly what I do, especially in isolation rooms
Lmao my department switched from purple gloves to black cause out emts were writing patient info on the gloves. To combat this we started using silver sharpies. 
Army medics just write shit on the patient’s forehead 
I write them in my brain. 
Honestly we just carry a roll of duct tape, stick it on the patient and write on that 
I will invariably throw out the gloves before transferring them to the computer.  Find me a pair of gloves that auto transfer and I will find a way to make my hospital pay for them
I could see this being useful for training purposes then.  Like a visual aid for new triage docs who haven't quite mastered the art of being cool under pressure
Is the ink non toxic?
Can confirm, I do this all the time. Patients think it's neat AF. But all my patients are old and adorable, so pretty much everything is neat AF to them.
“Shit what trashcan did I throw my gloves in? I need to document that heart beat”
Stop giving them ideas!
I worked for an ambulance company that charged $50 for gloves on every call.
Seems low for billing. I've been in the hospital a good few times sadly. Once I asked for an itemized list because my insurance had some questions, and on there I saw some of the most absurd things. In particular. A liter of saline, iv bag. 400 dollars no exaggeration. 400 bucks for a liter of saltwater and some iv tubing. 
Tomorrow there will be a news item on Reddit:

Hospitals charging thousands per patient for use of gloves. 
I'm guessing the information gets put on paper pretty soon after though? Because the gloves are considered a bio hazard after use. It's not like you're going to file it with the paperwork. 
I work in medical sales, hopefully I can help explain how this actually works. 

Any pricing you see on their website or Amazon is not the pricing end users in the hospital / physician office market would see. They get special pricing through distributors and GPO contracts. What you may see listed as 19.99 for a box online could end up in the $3-$6 range per box. 

So if this company is serious about doing business in the Emergency Department, they’ll need to work through a distributor or get on a GPO. Their pricing outside of that realm is irrelevant to their capacity to do business in the space they’re interested in. 

A good example of this is diapers. You go to the store, a pack of diapers can be like $12. They sell diapers to hospitals for less than a penny each. 
Can we bring gulags back? 
They must do. The one in the picture is clearly for a left handed person.
I'm pretty sure theres no HIPPA violation for vitals with no PT info on it.
> Also you have to live in constant fear that the HIPAA police will come out of nowhere and chop your hand off. 

Do you even know what HIPAA is?
My friend, let me introduce you to paper towel charting.  When thing really go south, you improvise.
Literally every EMT/Paramedic and half the nurses I know write on their gloves.

Proof: Am Paramedic
I know tons of firefighters that write on their gloves...
I just let the lifepak memorize *and* timestamp my vitals.
You take the vitals that you've written on your glove and write them on whatever charting system you use. 

I've done placements in emergency departments, gone out on ambulance runs, worked in intensive care and on wards and I've seen people do this in all of those environments.
I’m speaking to both sets. The price I was quoting was for one box of each. Even if it was $ 10 a box for 100 boxes the “normal” glove brand would be $2 a box for 100 boxes. That would be bulk pricing, and it would still be ridiculously priced. 
The cost to make these is most definitely not identical to the cost of making regular gloves. Look how gloves are made, and see if you see anywhere in the process where the glove is stretched flat enough to be screen printed. Even when done on balloons, this is a time-intensive, manual process, and balloons have radial symmetry. Adding processes to a large manufacturing operation is not as trivial as you may think.

And then go on amazon and type “medical gloves”.  Idk we should ask the company. 
Ever glove in the box should have this on it - as a right handed person please explain to me like I’m 5 ho his wouldn’t work for either handed person

Came here to say this. Stopped writing on my gloves after the first year at work.
This dude's bleeding to death and you want to be organized?
You learn to organize yourself really quick when you do this kind of work.
Doesn't really happen.  The number ranges are different enough that you wouldn't confuse them.  I did 5 years as an EMT and never ran into this issue once, nor did I see anyone else run into it.

It's a nice idea but completely unnecessary and, imo, not worth it at all.
“What do you mean your weight is 128/71 lbs???”
Granted I’m not in that profession, but from experience of interacting with healthcare personnel (I’ve had quite a bit due to a health condition) they are the type of people that have a system and would never make this mistake.
Nah, gloves are one use only. You won't use the same gloves for the same patient.
Most of us use sharpies or felt tipped pens 
this actually makes sense.  you dont replace ALL the gloves with these, just some of em for the new boys
While some countries have three healtcare providers on the ambulance, most only have two (plus the ocasional trainee). So until  a second unit arrives (if dispatched), you don't have the crew resources to assign a dedicated notetaker.
I 100% agree! But sometimes having someone just write stuff down isn't  feasible so worse comes to worse, have the cops jot some notes down for you
I’ve often put a clean glove on just to write it down in a pinch if I don’t have a notecard. Or if I’m getting signs for my partner and they can’t see the machine I’ll just hold my hand up with it on my glove so they can see it. 
So do people actually race to re-post something online when they’ve found a new interesting photo or something?
We did it Reddit!

Not a single post removed, touched or anything, he literally untouchable even disrespecting and breaking rules daily. Can repost and steal all the content he wants with no repercussions at all.

Fair enough, why then is able to post and breaks reddits rules everyday without any repercussion? I thought constant breaking of a rule on a subreddit would at least get a warning or mini-small ban or something?
Guarantee you dont lose your shit like this for anyone else that reposts, steals content, or even lies about the content of the post.

You dont even post anything, a leech absorbing all the content while contributing nothing. At least reposts are a chance for people that have never seen it before, yet you wanna cry about it because you've already seen it.
> Guarantee you dont lose your shit like this for anyone else that reposts

Hell no, because I don't get to catch them however, someone a mod that famous of stealing content for more then 2 years get to front page a lot of times by constantly breaking rules? I don't think that's fair.  

>You dont even post anything, a leech absorbing all the content while contributing nothing.

I surf where I want and post/comment on said places. I don't need to post my own posts because the last time I checked in order to use reddit I am not obliged to do so...  

>t least reposts are a chance for people that have never seen it before     
 
No, they're stolen content. Also, some subreddits he posted literally on their side bar on their god damn rules clearly stated :

>Rules    
1. No reposts.   

I'll wait for gallowboob minions.   
The point is your complaining about the type of content while contributing none. You're complaining about a free meal basically.
> The point is your complaining about the type of content while contributing none.

Wow oh great one teach me the ways of posting once a month. I don't care what people post about I do care when people break rules consistently and nothing happens.     

>You're complaining about a free meal basically.   

Well there are rules for a reason, and if someone breaks rules every day for at least the past 2 years. Yeah he is going to get called out.   


Most people wouldn't get mad at someone for stealing a pack of gum, but at GallowBoob's level it's closer to stealing a car. 

Don't get me wrong, a majority of the time his posts are *so* obviously stolen content that getting in a tizzy over it hardly seems worth the effort, but I don't think the complaints come from a desire for karma, as some would suggest. 

I know I've posted content that I didn't personally, individually create because I found it either on another site or a different subreddit and I crossposted it. Most people don't surf Reddit enough to catch even a small slice of the content that gets reposted, and that decisive vote is cast with ups & downs, so really if the community has decided that the post is worth voting for that's pretty much all the validation the post needs, regardless of how often it's been posted. 
I've been wondering the same for years.  It seems like it's a full time job for the dude.  Whatever, I guess.  
Why not?
Are you serious?  Would you be willing to put your child's life in the hands of a left-hander?
Well, I am left-handed, so thanks a lot I guess. I seriously don't see how being left-handed would matter in this situation.
Woosh. 
Ok, I don't get the joke. What am I missing?
He’s kidding... 
Honestly I had no idea those people could even read so now I feel terrible.
Lmao!
Oh, ok. Sorry. I thought he was some kind of superstitious person who actually thought left-handed people were evil or some shit like that.
I mean I can only guess, but I’m going to go out on a limb and say it was a joke. 
Yeah, I think/hope so. Godwin's law I guess..
They're being facetious...

For sure.

I don't know where you work but hospitals don't like it when we come in with our gloves on. Have to toss them before you enter and put a new pair on once inside the ER
Rescue Rick!  We're not laughing *at* you, we just happen to be in a jovial mood every time you walk by.
Hey, snapdangle, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

What a nice way to phrase this without being a dick :) 
I understand what they’re for. 
+ I call BS on the 71 diastolic... odd numbers arnt typically found on the standard even notched bp cuff. 

And the print is unnecessary because if I wrote 97.8, 108, 110/70, 16, 98%RA. Then anyone who takes vitals would already know which component I'm referring to just by the numbers without labeling T, P, BP, RR, O2 sat... Etc. 
Then proceed to yell “fuck” in my head when I toss my glove away in the trash 
RIP your pen
And then take them off and throw them before you actually document the obs? I do that all the time.

When I was in trauma ER we used to just write the initial handover and obs on each persons bed sheet at the foot whilst the medics were giving handover to the team. Worked well.
It’s still brilliant tho. 
Black gloves are not a good idea, what if the Patient has blood when palpating and you cant notice the blood due to black gloves.
Purple gloves? What is this Payday: The Heist?
Why would they not want you to write their info down?
why would they want to deter the EMTs from recording patient info? 
HIPAA is more what you'd call *guidelines* than actual rules
There have been many, many instances where I wish this was acceptable. 
Ouch. 
It seems kind of hard to find toxic ink at the office supply stores nowadays.


I wouldn’t drink it or anything, but I don’t think ink that would be harmful on skin or through a glove is common. 
Gloves like these are meant to stop the spread of infections and protect the person wearing them, not the patient. These gloves are not sterile. 
Ideas - 1 - $400
This bothers me so much. Ambulance bills are just flat out ridiculous.
Dam, a box is like $50,000 then. 
$15 for supplies.
$350 for knowing how to use it and administer it without killing you.
I agree some of it is outrageous, like 90 bucks for Tylenol, but to be fair, they don't include labor in the bill. The saline isn't $400, sticking a tube in your vein is. My new roof cost $8000 and its just wood and shingles.
You should google the price of a liter of normal saline. It’s hovering right at $300 at the moment. 
Not sure where you're getting your saline from, but one single 1L bag absolutely does not and should not cost $300. The first two results I looked at on Google yielded much, much lower prices ($16 and $5 respectively). What you're probably thinking of is a bulk pack of saline with multiple 1L bags in it.
America already has more people in jail then Soviets did at the peak of the gulag fad. We also have a higher incarceration rate. 
Only if you volunteer to go first. 


Also this guy is a conspiracy theorist and 9/11 truther, this can’t get any better. 
Correct. 
Unless you find the glove shoved up the patients ass
*HIPAA
Yeah, it was a joke, I don't think they would actually cut my hand off either. 
What's your second 'P' for?
Stupid fucker, you tell somebody my temperature and ILL SUE!
You joke but I once had a patient's family accuse me (through my company) of a lawsuit because I "purposefully" let their dog out when we went to pick up their elderly mother. Come to find they didn't have a dog and were dishonest scam artists. Needless to say we dropped her as a patient. Good time, people are awesome. 
Trust me, I know, family members work in med make defending the doctors,  the lawsuits are insane.  


So your 95 year old, double hip replacement, bed ridden grandmother who you had visited in 4 years was fine?  
Really, really south? Just use the patients blood! They likely won't need it soon. 
My all time favorite was duct tape right on the guys forehead.  
I just generalize at this point

“Heart rate was regular in the80s, bp 150s/90s, sugar in normal ranges”

They don’t really care if the systolic was 150 or 158

...unless their pressures shit or some other vital sign is shitty. I’ll commit that to memory
Not me. I change my gloves so often it wouldn't be practical. Out of the house into the truck? New gloves. Start an IV? New gloves. I go through 2 or 3 pairs per call.
I’m a lawyer and use to write case notes on the client’s face 
Yup, and we don't even check most vitals!

Most rookies go through their first year or 2 writing the primary survey on sets of gloves.

Ah
Wow it really is $20.

It's probably a product for try-hards looking to impress people. 
Yeah me too but I just stopped wearing gloves all together. I get yelled at by my boss at jimmy johns for it all the time 
Presumably, that's why you want to be organized. Taking a few seconds to figure out which number you wrote down was which is worse than knowing where it is automatically.
The Checklist Manefesto by Atul Gawande explains how important organizational systems are in the medical field. Not saying these expensive gloves are necessary but organization  definitely is
The dudes bleeding to death, the numbers don't matter.  Stop the bleeding, get moving to the hospital, and get an IV going. 

*edit.  The viral signs can be looked up and printed from the cardiac monitor at any time. 
that's one dumb comment man
Hey! So is yours! I had 100 other dumb people agree with my dumb comment!
Not worth it for sure. 
> The number ranges are different enough that you wouldn't confuse them.

HR and Sp02 seem similar (Heart Rate and Oxygen Saturation I assume?)
The extra cost associated, and at least in my department, it’s looked down upon by management to write on gloves. They call it a hippa thing since it has vitals of the patient written on it, and can have other identifying factors. 
I'm being pedantic but you won't ever have an odd number in a BP.
Plenty of odd numbers using automatic blood pressures
Yeah, like 166/44. I got that and thought it was odd, turns out the cuff was broken
 lol I've seen my fair share of odd ones too. But in case it needs clarification: in hospitals we use monitors that can take an automatic BP that will indeed show odd numbers in the BP. The even numbers only thing only applies when you're taking a manual BP.
A lot of pre-hospital monitors also have auto BP. 
Yeah so I've found out. Only makes sense I suppose.
That's fair but if you're writing it on you glove it's probably manual because if it is on the monitor it auto populates my report. WiFi shit. You can also scroll through trends so idk why you'd have an odd BP on your glove.
Eh true but you're first comment wasn't worded that way and as you said: pedantic. Also it's possible because some hospitals (see my first job) only had shitty little rolling monitors that don't have wifi or even a fancy touch screen. So if we're being pedantic than you'd still have scenarios where you write an automatic BP on a glove. 
I guess that is possible. Still a silly concept for a glove. Do both gloves have it? I have to make sure the vitals side is facing me? All around it's silly. I jumped the gun. I prefer a manual first and then monitor so I never write an odd one on my glove and then if it is on the monitor I don't write it on me.
Plenty of places that only have manual entry, so the machine takes all the readings and displays them, but doesn't auto populate the report.
  
Most nurses I know run around with a piece of paper anyhow, and that's where the vitals end up (next to the patients name no less).
I mean if you're defending the gloves ok. But what nurse writes a report with gloves on? Most computers are rolling. If you write a report while typing that's cross contamination because it isn't a computer per room. If they go to the station they aren't bringing used gloves with them. Or they shouldn't be. What if they go into a Cdiff room? The gloves are useless.

This is a clever idea from someone who has never worked in the medical field.
Oh I agree, the gloves are a gimmick at best. And I didn't downvote you, but I can see why "WiFi shit" might not earn you many points, despite being technically accurate.
  
My point was that the results get written down on a piece of paper we all carried anyhow, and then entered into the computer at the nurses station in one go. Rolling computers are only for med rounds here. 
This isn’t the 80’s. Even BLS IFT trucks have auto cuffs now...
That's fair but if you're writing it on you glove it's probably manual because if it is on the monitor it auto populates my report. WiFi shit. You can also scroll through trends so idk why you'd have an odd BP on your glove.
I cant speak to that. I don’t write stuff on my gloves to begin with, so I have no frame of reference for when it is or isn’t done.

Personally, I think these are nonsense, but at the same time I really wish I had thought of the idea and brought it to market. It’s a stupid idea, but new EMTs are generally pretty willing to spend money they don’t have on useless shit they don’t need, so this product might actually be reasonably successful. 
I agree. They may work for someone but when I write on my gloves I have my preference for how I do it and I do it the same way every time. There isn't a confusion. Nobody is handing gloves off so they should all know their own system.
How does that work? 
Do they only calculate it by 2 or something?
A manual cuff only marks every 2. You always report it as an even number.
Only if you took it manually. If you took it with an automatic BP cuff it could come out as an odd number.
I can't even imagine how a ball point would effectively write on rubber. I have enough trouble getting them to write on paper.
Right and I’ve been on both scenarios, but if you’re writing it down on your glove just lean two inches to the left and write it down on paper or a board. Gloves get dirty and torn or thrown away before someone remembers to copy info. I just always saw it as an extra step that never worked as well as just writing it down normally. 
I Finland we usually have two paramedics per ambulance and on each case the driver is the notetaker and the other one is the guy who checks the vitals etc. They use crm to convey information both ways.
I’m curious if some agencies allow audio recorders, it would be so easy to track treatment just by telling everything out. I’ve seen cameras installed in trauma bays for various reasons so I wonder if ambulances would be different. 
Flight nurse here. A foot of 3" tape on the leg is your friend. Our monitors record data but our vents don't so it's useful to record trends in PIPs and PPlats, esp in chest trauma. I know lots of people that write on gloves, but I always end up forgetting and throwing them away. 
I mean, it’s reddit. People race to repost reposts every day. 
Considering GallowBoob sits at home making a living salary based off doing that alone, yeah. 
Yes?
> Which rules?

First thing that pop in my mind that happened last week, he stole content from a redditor called /u/amythelamey and she got mad that he stole her content, she had no idea her own content was being posted without consent. She had to make her own post or else... You can even read some of the comments if you feel the need.     
.Anyway that's when I found out how shitty and a thief this mod is.  

Anyway on one the subreddits he posted again stolen content  and one of the rules was:
>Rules    
 1. No reposts.  

He reposted anyway . most of the time nothing happen to his posts. Most of his posts are either reposts or stolen content. And he posts even when he shouldn't. So far nothing has ever happened to him, so yeah there's that.

"I have a really high pain tolerance though. Like, the highest of all my friends."
Hah. It’s gotten to the point when they just ask for dilaudid. 
I always toss mine, wash up in their sink, and then put on new ones. Unless I’m in the middle of compressions or ventilating a PT, my gloves always get changed and my hands always get washed immediately. 
U r gay lol no buy these glove 
Even then, writing any of those letters take no time to write. 
And then I forget to transcribe them before throwing my gloves away and now I'm racking my brain trying to remember my vitals
Hey thanks for doing what you do.... maybe one day I’ll need your help

I’m curious. What are some of the vitals
You guys look for? Or is there a umbrella term for them all that I can google? 
Yep.  Don’t need those gloves, sometimes I write on the alcohol swab packages 
That reminds me. Several years back we once had a patient that came into ER with 108 F temp (tympanic). He was delirious and later had a seizure too. He had urosepsis IIRC. He soon died :(
Bingo
ok but you have to realise that you just took values that would support your point. 98 can be pulse, oxygen and temperature and pressure too but there's prob no confusion there.

also I noticed you abbreviated Respiratory Rate as RR which is weird because where I'm from people often refer to blood pressure as RR which is short for Riva Rocci, who is the guy who invented the inflatable sphygmomanometer 
>And the print is unnecessary because if I wrote 97.8, 108, 110/70, 16, 98%RA. Then anyone who takes vitals would already know which component I'm referring to just by the numbers without labeling T, P, BP, RR, O2 sat... Etc.

I create medical software and this workflow you've described is clear risk. We'd identify this as a high risk workflow and we would NEVER allow this in software, for obvious reasons.

I get that it works, but labeling is proven important and I am willing to bet that while the occurrence of mistake is low, that it is still probably way too high. If even 2% of the time unlabeled writing is misinterpreted, that's a lot, and if it leads to even one preventable death, then it's something we should be able to improve. 

Damn we need like Google Assistant/Alexa for the ED where you can just call out values or write them with a stylus and the computer is listening and updating an e-chart in real time, that is being displayed for you. IDK maybe one day we'll improve this for you, sorry. 
"102? Fuck, what was this supposed to be? Oh. That's right. This patient has a terrible batting average."
Every damn time
The cheap Bic type stick pens with at least a medium point write on gloves well & it does mess them up, but I wouldn’t use any other type of pen. 
Not really.... Not at all. Here's why:

Each vital sign has its own range.

If you gave me that same list of numbers without any labeling, I can tell you exactly which is which.
No, it’s not. 

Someone *thought* it was brilliant and then they demanded way too much money for one box of gloves. Duh. 

That’s the opposite of brilliant, imho. 
It's definitely easier to tell with light-coloured nitrile gloves, but it's not impossible to tell with black ones either. You can almost immediately feel that you're touching liquid and, if you're unsure of the colour of said liquid, you can quickly wipe it on the ground and tell.
Purple nitrile and grey nitrile are the standard ones from Halyard
Purple nitrile gloves are far and away the most common.

Source: Worked in labs for over 10 years now.
Purple and blue are really common.  
Peoples privacy. The stuff we write in reports is public.
Private information that is protected under most privacy laws in most countries. Handling and disposing of said information has specific rules, and in most cases simply throwing it into the trash does not suffice. Violating those privacy laws, even inadvertently, can spell trouble. 
If it included names/locations then it could be considered a HIPAA violation. That's really my only guess. But the gloves should, theoretically, never leave a situation in which that person's PMI would be relevant. Seems odd.

LPT: whenever you want to write something in snow 'manually,' drink some ink!
I mean you can get sterile gloves, they're just outrageously expensive. 
That's cheap for an idea.
Ideas - Money - $400
Going to have to charge another 50 because I have to code it into ICD9 now....
Ideas are a dime a dozen.
It's cause nobody pays, so they gotta make up the cost of operating with the people that can pay 
But wouldn't the labour be put into a separate line? 
Yes. Do the people in the ambulance get the money thou? I've heard they get paid pretty low wages :(

I wish the money could actually go TO them.   
Its more like 15 in supplies a 100 to make it in a sterile factory another 200 to make the insurance company think its getting a good deal and the rest for operations.
That's still stupid
I'd be impressed if anyone could kill someone with a bag of saline.
We charge somewhere around $175 for our 1,000cc bags. A blanket will cost you $60 whether you request one or not and we charge for oxygen on every call supposedly even if it isn’t documented/ administered. 
To be fair the material costs for a roof's worth of lumber and shingles isn't exactly low on it's own
This is one of the most ignorant and offensive comments I’ve ever seen. 
I trust "Mr. Eagle" as a good source. Surely his favorate animal has nothing to do with the United States.
Would you like to talk about any of my specific conspiracy posts, or are you just... *too superior*? Bonus points if you jokingly say you are instead of write a challenge. 
At that point, you’ve got bigger problems.

Portability & Accountability*
As long as systolic is over 100
I'm a case manager and write progress notes on napkins quite often
Yeah totally an accurate analogy 
“Hey is 18 my respiration’s or heart rate?” -no one ever 
Each of those numbers are so different from each other you don’t need to categorize lol 
We know which number is which 
Not really. If you have a Stat code you're not wasting time getting vital signs, you're either stopping the bleeding or doing CPR to keep that person alive. The hospital can worry about vitals.
Take an extra second to write an acronym next to the number ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. 
First, you're exactly right that HR = heart rate and SpO2 = % saturation of O2 in blood.  You're also right that SpO2, temp, and pulse can all be in the 90s.

I should have said they're all written differently.  For temp, I always put a decimal as well as an F next to the number (e.g. 98.6F). No other vital is written with a decimal or a letter.  For SpO2, I put the type of O2 they're getting (e.g. if they're breathing on their own, I put "RA" for room air. If they're using a nasal cannula at 2 liters/minute, I write 2LNC, etc).  Only pulse would have a 2-3 digit number with no other markup.

Also, I would always write the five vitals in the same order so they wouldn't be confused.

tl;dr - Most EMTs come up with a convention to write their vitals so they never confuse them, and these new gloves wouldn't make them more efficient/consistent

Edit: If you're curious, for a patient with a temp/o2sat/pulse of 98, this is how I'd write them

* 120/80

* 98

* 98 RA

* 98.0F

* 16

That isn't the order I'd usually write them in, but I clumped the 98s together just so you can see what I mean when I say I'd never confuse them on an unlabeled glove
Oxygenation/Saturation will never go above 100, and would usually be in the high 90ies(unless you work with people that have lung or heart problems) ;)
  
Either way, you will usually take vitals in a set fashion, and therefore write them down the same way every time anyhow. If you have a all in one unit, it will have a display grid that shows the results, and if you always start top left, then you will always write the numbers the same way.
Put a % next to SpO2 or the O2 delivery rate. Or just write “Sat” before it if it could be ambiguous
His pulse is 82.  It must be Bob!!!!
Really?

I could see if you have their name or age or something on it but just if you have BP/pulse/RR/spo2/temp?  That sounds like someone was sued for HIPAA and the department is overreacting.
Tell them they're idiots. 
Is it a problem in a hospital setting, where every minute potentially counts? 

Just curious.
> Someone should be responsible for notations alone.

> if you’re writing it down on your glove just lean two inches to the left and write it down on paper or a board

These are two completly different scenarios, so you can't have your cake and have it too.

Taking a quick note on your glove, is simply a time saving improvisiation, it's the post-it of Field Work.
Audio recordings could be used in a violation of HIPPAA. When you get back to station you can usually annotate by voice, but on the trucks I don't know of any tough books that can do that. Youd have to use a handheld or something 
We've been told no, recording devices would be considered a HIPAA violation 
I have so much to learn
To be fair some people don't know they are reposts & some are karma whores. I've reposted on accident when I noticed something online & thought "Reddit will get a kick out of this" but others are blatant about Karma'ing up to sell the user name.
Stolen content (which, and I know I’m going against the grain here, is probably debatable) aren’t reposts. Meaning no rules were broken in that instance. 
I came here anticipating a roast session on these gloves by medical professionals 😂
Well arguably every second counts in emergency response. 
It's all about seconds and inches
And they can change rapidly 
But writing all of them takes over a second. 
every time. or you're turning a nasty glove inside-out trying to salvage them after youve taken them off
And then you make up vitals as close as you can remember. I agree, pitching your gloves is a habit. 
Temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation 
Vitals taken are generally pulse, blood pressure, peripheral O2 levels (spO2), temperature, and respiratory rate. Occasionally mean arterial pressure can be recorded but it's a little rarer.
Also blood sugar. 
Where is that from where RR is used instead of BP? I think that's the exception. 

The values in relation to their normal ranges make it obvious 99% of the time, and if not, then you can take the 0.01 second to write T or P, etc., or just write it in the standard order every time. Standard order for rounds on medicine wards is: T, P, BP, RR, SpO2. 
"Alexa, blood pressure hundred and four"

"Got it. Blood pressure hitting the floor. Writing that' down."
I think your comment exemplifies how front line staff and back end computer guys have a disconnect that leads to pointless complexities in EMRs. 
No, it's the fact that you're using your pen in an isolation room!  It's all fun and games till you get the diff and start to pee out your butt.
Except when all the numbers are 40. Although at that point things aren't going well regardless. 
Even if you didn’t, you’d still only be faced with writing at most 2 extra letters per stat. You can write “BP” in under a second easily. Also, question: is it possible that any of these stats could be confused for another if one or more were anomalously high or low? 
98 

92

Which one is HR and which is O2?
Huh? If someone is suffering a medical emergency, Some of these numbers would likely be way out of their ranges. You couldn’t use “normal range” to judge which number is which. 

Not that I think these gloves are a great idea, but your theory is rubbish.
Ya but we would still know what is what because they all have their own abnormal range as well. That's my point. Example: spo2 will never be 100

A blood pressure is always gonna be two numbers, or one number and an X if there is no diastolic. spo2 will never be above 100. Respirations will rarely be over 30, and if they are  then that number isn't even relevant anymore.

Also, people will typically write them in the same order every time. I always to BP at a given HR with Respirations at a given SPO2.

Here's what they look like on someone with massive hemorrage:
 80/X  134  28  93. Easy to read. No one even writes down the GCS that's easy to recall.
They'd make more money underselling current regular gloves. I can't imagine the markup of gloves for hospitals.
I don't see how your HR or RR is going to misused though? I agree with anythings that can identificate the patient.
Hazmat disposal probably isn't insured/certified to handle sensitive info either. You're probably putting them in a sticky situation if they're not following rules with the gloves. 
For greedy douches
You must not be getting paid since you're still using ICD 9. 
Nope. Hospitals don't charge you for labor. It's included in the cost of items 
EMT’s and Paramedics (people in the ambulance) generally get paid shit. I got my EMT certification a few years ago in preparation of Firefighter training and all the people I was in class with left their respective EMT jobs within a year to do something else because the pay did not match the stress in such a high call volume area. 

EDIT: So to answer your question, no they do not. 
EMS wages are pretty shitty, unfortunately. At least where I am now, the benefits are decent and covered at 100% by the county. 
...... in a factory in Puerto Rico where the labor costs are even lower... 
Good grief. 😮 ours is just the typical BLS/ALS/ALS 2 schedule. If we do an iv/monitor/a few drugs, it’s ALS. I forgot what makes it ALS 2... I stay out of billing.
Like a missing glove? 
They "fell" on it. 
I'm not greedy, I'll take 80
HR is 77%, BP is 110mL/dL
It's a bad day when the answer to that question is yes.
Sure, but the issue isn't recognizing which number is which, its finding it quickly among a hastily scrawled list of unlabeled symbols. I'm not arguing for the gloves, only for organization of data.
I was being sarcastic.. monitors hold all your data you’d get from writing on these gloves. 

Stuff you write on the fly is usually timing related that you have to manually input. They just wouldn’t have much use. 
Organization is designed to help you find something in a mess, as much if not more so than helping you recognize what it is once you find it.
Yes I understand what organization means but there’s also a thing called practicality. Each of those numbers are significantly different. HR-30-150, BP number/number, Sp02 %, RR 12-15, GCS you label/look at the patient. You don’t need a categorized glove in a critical patient 
I'm not arguing for the gloves, I was arguing against the comment disregarding the value of organization.
Underrated comment.
Yes. But I've known what number was which in a set of data that was just written as a long, disorganized mess before. That doesn't mean I quickly found it again -- not as quickly as I would have if I could have skimmed a label column. The original comment was about being organized.

Exactly. I'm not arguing for the gloves, I'm arguing that the comment discregarding the value of organization is wrong.
p98, T98 (though I use C), 98%
this guy medicals
You also sometimes get a heart drawn next to pulse, or you could just take an extra second to write bpm (beats per minute), so either ❤️98 or 98bpm
O2 I use %, T I use the decimal, and pulse is just straight numbers.  Now if they have those in the 90s and their glucose is or something else like HR then we are not only confused, but working on what the hell happened.
98 for a blood sugar seems reasonable too.
It's not recommended to write on your glove to begin with because even if you have a sterilised pen with you, you're going to change gloves very frequently. Much simpler to just write it on the paper which is right next to you as well.
I’d say time matters even more out of the hospital. You don’t have all the available resources that hospitals have on an ambulance. So being able to leave quickly and find advanced care is crucial. In hospitals if you have a code there is usually a team, so there are several people available as resources to remember vitals. But out of hospital it’s usually 2 or if you get fire to respond a few, but you won’t always have the team for the duration of the call. 
Hey, El\_Mosquito, just a quick heads-up:  
**completly** is actually spelled **completely**. You can remember it by **ends with -ely**.  
Have a nice day!

I personally don't care about the first set of vitals on scene, I do them just to make sure there isn't anything fucky going on. I'll do 2 more sets of vitals en route to the hospital (if im not driving) and write those ones down and then a 3rd set at the hospital for the triage nurse. 
But it's not though, because you can't give these vitals to anyone. No one anywhere is accepting dirty gloves with writing on them. If you use this method you're committing to writing vitals at least twice, once on the glove, and again on paperwork given to the receiving facility. Just write vitals on a notepad, this doesn't have anyone any time and is promoting poor ppe use by encouraging wearing the same ppe throughout the entire call. Gross.
Did it for 8 years. It is that easy. No one died because of note taking. 
Protip: Repost this now so that you're ahead for the next round of reposts 
Not really
Ohh hadn’t thought of that either. What’s the value in having an account with a lot of karma? As far as I know users can’t make any money from Reddit like YouTubers do. 
>Stolen content (which, and I know I’m going against the grain here, is probably debatable) aren’t reposts.

I didnt say they were?

I'll quote myself:  

>**Anyway on one the subreddits he posted again**    

    Rules    
    1. No reposts.

He clearly is breaking a rule here.   




Popcorn! Get your popcorn!
I'd expect nothing less on Reddit.
You're not writing anything down when you're in a situation where every second counts. There's someone dedicated to paperwork that's writing it down when you call it out. 
The time it takes to write out an extra letter literally does not make a difference 
 Nuh uh
Figuratively.
There's always gotta be one of you people in every fucking thread doesn't there?
In theory maybe, but not in practice. That's why they say the first pulse you take in an emergency situation is your own. If the difference between saving a patient and losing a patient depends on seconds realistically you were never going stand a chance of saving them. 
Also every person to attend care if possible takes their own vitals of the patient. Standard protocols. 
Pretty sure movies and TV exaggerate this all to hell. I think it's fair to say there's *some* degree of truth to it, but like... you go into the ER and depending on how dire your situation is considered and how crowded it is, you may be waiting hours. Movies and TV make it seem like every medical emergency is literally the most important thing in the universe that needs to be taken care of *now*. 

As it was put to me one time at the ER \(and this was with a fairly bad condition, where they got me in pretty quick\) "I can't move you up as a priority any more unless you need CPR." As it is, they got me under their watch pretty quick, but there was still quite a bit of waiting after. I would go into more detail as to what, but I don't know want to share all my medical history on the internet. :P
Sweet thanks !
I’m gonna look up arterial pressure 

Thanks for responding 
Blood sugar is also in protocol now. 
Still better than doctor handwriting 🤷
Well you see, you're wrong. If you have two containers in the fridge and they are unlabeled, the outside of the containers look exactly the same but you have glue in one and milk in the other. Milk usually goes on the left but in your refrigerator, milk goes on the right. You grab the one you think is milk and have a nice cold glass of glue. 
I'm not saying it doesnt happen, but likely doesnt change any clinical outcomes. Most vital signs that are significant enough to make a decision that would determine life or death would be repeated, so its a non-issue. 
Well yes but there is a slight chance that those vitals could mean death is the o2 is misinterpreted as the temp. There are other situations but that's the most obvious to me
I wipe the pen down with bleach every time
You wouldnt just write 98 for the O2 sat. You need to right the way they are breathing also, which most of the time is room air, so you would write it 98RA, which would differentiate it from the pulse
96 

99

Which one is temp which one is HR
That's where Celsius is superior
EMS doesn't take temp
All you have to do is write % which most do. 
You could just draw a heart or spell HR next to it when it's ambiguous. But the SpO2 will always have something written next to it because your need to know if it's Room Air or oxygen support, for example.
I draw a heart next to the HR :)
> 98 
>92
>Which one is HR and which is O2?

That’s why you write a **%** after one of the numbers. 
I think a better comparison would have been which is HR and which is body temp \(in Fahrenheit\), although TBF most of the ~~civilised~~ world uses Celsius which would avoid confusion.
Neither there both penile measurements: erect and flaccid 
It likely can't, but it's the position of some companies that "it *might* be therefore don't do it." I don't necessarily agree with that position, myself.
Nope gotta code it first in ICD9, then recode it in ICD10, since we still have a bunch of offices in Kansas that can't afford the upgrades in the rural small towns yet. 
I see... never had one myself. 
One in a million, doc.
Diastolic 80 and talking to me? I'll take it!

Don’t know if I’ve ever seen an 18 and 18 ... usually guppy breathing by the time the heart rate is that low if you’re letting them pass. 

Wonky one I did see was pleth hit 0 right before we cric’d someone with a decent waveform... in the moment all I could think was “is that even possible”
Ha! I like this bot. :P

LimbRetrival-Bot...
Good bot
If someone's temp is 98C they're fuuuuuuucked
Aww I wish I was still an EMT so I could draw little hearts
I didn't take that with every patient so that would usually either be off in its own space or I'd just label it.  It's not on that glove so the glove itself doesn't solve the problem anyway.  You're absolutely right that 98 is a reasonable glucose though!
I believe Sharpies use alcohol in their ink, so it self sterilizes.  
You're absolutely right.  When I could, I would write on a piece of paper.  However, if I was in the field and holding a patient with one hand and asked to write down vitals, I would rather write on my glove than let go of the patient to find paper.

It wasn't my standard procedure, but it would be ridiculous to expect the uncontrolled chaos that is field medicine to always follow one routine.
That's not a very helpful memorization tip.
Good bot. 
So you are suggesting, that after I got bodily fluids or any other contaminating substance on my gloves I should grab a Notepad and thus risking crosscontamination ?

If something gets on the BP Cuff, Stethoscope, Backpack I can clean and desinfect them. Good Luck trying to desinfect a papernotebook.

No one is getting the Glove as some Sort of Appendix to the Report, they a carbon copy of my report, which doesn't get handed out until finished and signed.
Which standard phrase would you prefer as an answer.

A) Oh, thats cute thats nearly half the time, If been doing this.  
B) Yeah you can do your Job wrong for X Years.  
C) I would like to see some data to back up that claim.  
D) Might explain why you're talking about it in the past tense.  

Please choose one or multiple from the Options listed below.

On a serious note, no one is forcing you to use a trick of thie trade, it's another tool in the toolbag. You don't wanna use it that is fine, but don't pretend like you have one up about those that know the trick and use it.
I don't know the full scope of it but if you have an Acct. With a lot of karma either Companies or political parties will buy it & try to Subliminally push there message upon reddit. So mainly Influence. If I'm wrong & someone knows more than me please correct me.

I was a combat medic, so there wasn't anyone to write down our stuff for us, even then I wouldn't use these gloves. I used a long strip of 3 inch silk tape on one of my thighs.

Before the patient got transport, I'd pop that and a field medical card on them, because FMCs tended to blow away or get lost. That fucking tape would stay there.  
That's better then. 
Shh, if it matters on TV it matters in real life. 
It takes essentially no time to have typed a period in your post to make it a complete sentence but here we are.
Not a missing period! Oh, the humanity!
People like you make me sad.
Grandma just died cause you took the time to type that out. Hope you're happy. 
Shut up you addict
Take a chill pill, grandpa. 
Blood sugar is also standard now. 
I shudder at the thought of trying to map 9 to 10 since the 10 codes are often so much more specific.
I have more questions...
GCS is 106 and rising

The patient is now thinking in 11 dimensions
Hey I knew some of those words! 
Oh it's possible.  Had somebody bite the tube and the ER doc refused to paralyze them, sat in the teens for 10 minutes until the intensiveist walked in.  That was a formal but well deserved ass chewing.
I have a watch that checks my heart rate. I used to be  a medic and work in insurance adjustment and decided to see what my HR was like when I slept. It dropped to 32. I nearly shit myself the next morning reading it. Went to a cardiologist and he ordered a Holter unit and osat unit for a night of sleeping. HR dropped to 31 and I had osat of 94. 

After a few other tests (echo, ekg and blood work) I learned 1: my heart is just healthy 2: it's just bradycardia and 3: I'm lucky I had awesome insurance because my total out of pocket was $250 and those tests are fucking expensive. 4: I need to chill the hell out sometimes.

Ninja edit: I got out of medical because I started doing that thing nearly every medical professional does: self diagnose. That and I can't stand in an ambulance without breaking my damn neck and hurting my back. 
Remember to use your none pharmaceutical interventions. Just give them an ice pack and they will be just fine long enough to hand over to someone else and run.
I don't think life as we know it is compatible above 65. Thermophiles. Funny thing is that they live at the bottom of the ocean. Crazy mixed up world. 
You could always dot your i with one.
I thought alcohol disinfects
This bot gets the same reaction every single time. I think it's hilarious.
You need to learn to pronounce it complete-eely for it to work

Just like b-e-a-u-tiful
A more useful tip would be that you write the \*complete\* word "complete" and then stick the ly on the end.

Alternatively, the easiest way to remember how to spell completely is to remember which letters are used and in which order they are used. And then you'll remember it every time!
Yea, take your gloves off and write it down on your notepad. It's the same thing you would do with your tablet.
Hey, godfather33087, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

Love you, MJ, but close your damn mouth when you chew.
That's awesome.
That's the standard method in the field
I actually like that better. Nothing worse than using gloves then absently throwing them away. I like that the tape can go directly with the patient. 
Coffee and crullers, stat!

It's a huuuuuggggeeee pain in the ass. But it helps people so I don't mind it. 
Hmmmm... Yeah. That may have been worded poorly.

I am a paramedic, if that helps narrow down your questions!
Pt is alert, and responsive to interdimentional stimuli. Pupils are equal and can see through your soul. 
Would that lead to brain damage? 
Bradycardia is supposedly common among athletic individuals per my med school professor.

He had a funny story about how when he was an intern that wasn't funny.
If you're having trouble remembering how to spell beautiful, just use this helpful tip: it's spelled beautiful.
Scribbling on your Glove is a time-saving manuever, if I have the time to take my gloves of, grab the clipboard, mark the Patients Vital signs on the chart and reglove before continuing patient care I wouldn't even thing about scribling on my glove.

My what ?  
I don't bring Personal Entertainment Devices on a call.
Thanks. Honestly I appreciate it. A lot of times I type something I'm thinking "I hope this is right"
Yeah, way to go /u/godfather33087 you fucking idiot. Alot needs to be done about these spelling mistakes.
Good bot.
I love you both
Yeah, I'm just saying that even when there's no one to transcribe for you, these gloves are still stupid.
No, more of the Diastolic and talking.  Gotta love those moments in the back of the ambulance when you just sort of raise an eyebrow like...uh...ok...I mean sure...this can’t be right...but ok.


Gotten some fucked up numbers before and had the great moment where you just want to poke the equipment.
