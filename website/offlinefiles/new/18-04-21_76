Netflix The WITCHER TV series news: 8 episodes, 2020 air date, will adapt the first two books and will film in Poland.

Seems like they are taking their time with it, which is good. This could be a huge show
I like that they're filming in Poland. A neat gesture.
4 episodes a book? I guess it depends on how long an episode is and the quality of writing
There's a lot of ways this could go wrong, but imagine if it goes *right*? I love The Witcher, read all the books and played all the games. It's a beautiful world with really compelling characters and a very solid story.

I really, *really* hope this show does the books justice. It could be very well a big hit and draw some big numbers from the void GoT will leave (though these 2 fantasy works aren't very alike). The showrunner is very enthusiastic about it, I'm hopeful for now.
Honestly thank god they are adapting the books.

I feel like adapting that will do geralt and co so much more justice than re-hashing the 3 games plot.
It's gonna be a long wait
8 episodes... that's a bit interesting. Makes you wonder which of the short stories they will adapt into the TV series.

&nbsp; 

* "Voice of Reason" is fairly easy to have both included or cut, depending on the way the series narrate the story. 
* I'm guessing "The Witcher" will also be included, since that story is both fairly good at introducing what Geralt is, build up the political aspect, introduce Foltest etc, while also being a fairly iconic story.
* I'm guessing "A grain of truth" and "The lesser evil" might be cut, since they are fairly stand-alone and do not tie up to any other major character.
* "A question of price" is guaranteed, I'd imagine, if they are including Ciri. Hard to get by the introduction of her parents and grandmother.
* "The Edge of the World" is both a story easy to cut, but also a story that introduces Dandilion and the general unrest between human and non-humans, so.. I'd imagine it'd be included.
* The Last Wish is probably guaranteed, as it introduces Yennefer and it is the titular short story of the first collection.

&nbsp;

* I would love for "Bounds of Reason" to be included, if only for Villentretenmerth, but I'd imagine they'd cut out this one as I'd imagine the effects would be expensive to create him. :P

* They might end up cutting "A shard of ice" to not confuse the audience way too much about the rollercoaster relationship between Geralt and Yennefer.

* I couldn't ever see them adapt "Eternal Flame", as that is literally the short story version of fetch quests incarnate. :P

* "A little sacrifice" is one I hope is included. It fleshes out Dandilion, and the story itself is sad and could do well with being adapted to a series, so.. 

* "The Sword of Destiny" seems to be an auto-include, with Ciri and all, as would "Something more". Wonder how they'll handle the obvious time skips between those two stories though, as they are back to back.

&nbsp;

Either way, I can wait 2-2.5 years for that show. I just hope they do the books justice. I'm midway through Time of Contempt now, and I'm surprised how well Sapkowski write.
I am very curious as to how they decently handle all the different time-skips between the short stories though. That can end up horribly wrong if not done properly.
I hope that guy in the thumbnail is Geralt 
I was like "2020? That's more than a decade awa....."
Netflix and Zach McGowan need to start negotiating how many crowns Zach will get for playing Geralt ASAP
It's interesting that they plan to only do the first two books (I presume The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny which will work well in an 8 episode format) but they also intend to include Bonhart so presumably we'll be getting plenty of set up for the rest of the series.
Wish they were doing more than 8 episodes. There is a lot they can do with these stories. Hopefully it does well and there are many seasons! So excited.
I hope more people watch, and support, this more than they did Altered Carbon. AC was amazing and a second season is looking unlikely...Netflix could do a better job marketing this also. 
Please don’t be shit
Please don’t be shite
Please don’t be shit 
This TV show could be Igni
I don't think Zach McGowan should play Geralt. I like him, he was very good in Black Sails and superb in Shameless. But this role?
Has anyone seen the hexer series? I hope this new one is better.
I guess I should get back to reading the second book then. The first one was awesome.
I like it. Makes sense that they'd combine the first 2 books into 1 season since they're more a collection of short stories. The real meat and potatoes of the story doesn't really start till the 3rd book, at which point I suspect they'll dedicate full seasons to each one.
The first five episodes will be Geralt trying to figure out how to parry an attack and rooting around some bins for a diagram.
Pls be Mads Mikkelsen for the Witcher or I'll riot.
Zach McGowan? Excellent choice if they pick him imo. The voice and stature are the 2 things that really sell it for me; he can very well emulate that deep, husky voice Geralt had in the games, and he can carry himself the way Geralt does pretty easily too. Would be very pleased to see him if he's cast.
I hope I live until then.
How similar are the books to the games? 
Great news, always loved the books and games. 
Awesome that they are filming it in Poland, it's a beautiful country 
I hope the story of the serie is as good as in the game and books. 
It better be fucking good!
Hopefully they will try to be consistent with the world and it's internal logic, same as GoT. 
This is the best fucking news.
I really hope this turns out good.
My only complaint is that I have to wait 2 years... Good things come to those who wait i guess
The the episodes are the length of a Sherlock episode, so about a movies length each.
They would need that time for the unicorn sex scene.
only 8? and first 2 books, does that mean the last wish and sword of destiny? or blood of elves and time of contempt?
That's so far away!
Who was cast as Geralt and Triss? The most important questions.
Anthony Starr should play Geralt 
Can't wait to see that Striga battle.

2020? Fuck sake.
is the butthurt author  working on this? He'll   end up ruining it somehow if he does.
HOLY FUCKING SHIT!
This is going to be the whitest show you have ever seen. Exciting. The kvetching will be intense.
I went to Zamek Ojców a little while back. That place has got Witcher written all over it. I'd be amazed if they didn't use it for filming.
202 eh? I remember when they announced Lost in Space a few years back and watching it now I'm glad they took their sweet time. The visuals are absolutely great. Sometimes I forget Netflix can dish out the cash for on location shooting and sick CGI when they need to. 
I hope they don't care about how many episodes they have and don't cram too much into it.
A lot of potential in this. 
Who is playing yen she is bae 
I've just started reading the first book after falling in love with Witcher 3. I cannot wait for this show, it's going to be amazing. 
I have but one question.  WHO IS PLAYING YEN?

Wait,  the Witcher is a book? I've only heard of the game
Good timing too, this next season of Game of Thrones is supposed to be the last one. There will definitely be a vacuum in the market waiting to be filled. 
Y Km a😂
😁
yes kurwa
first two books in 8 episodes.... hmmmmmmmmmmm
I hope it goes well. I have little faith in Netflix but I already have the subscription so I will watch it at some point.
2020 huh, damn still quite awhile off.

Good choice adapting the first two books, definitely the easiest 
Oh yeah
YEEEEAAAAA!
Time to get hyped (if it wasn't before).
They're taking their time, this is good.
I thought this was in development hell for awhile after hearing nothing about this. I'm glad we are definitely hearing more about this now. Slightly unrelated but I hear that the Halo Steven Spielberg series is still coming so I am just as equally excited for that too.
Mads Mikkelsen would kill this. There’s my vote
The internet will be filled with people criticizing everything that isn't like the games.
8 episodes for 2 books??? That won't cover most of it. If it's the short stories, then an alright percentage of it but I don't think 8 episodes is enough
Jim Caviezel would be a dope Geralt. He has the voice and even resembles Geralt a little too. Plus he can definitely play the role considering his work on Person of Interest.
I wonder if by first to books they are talking about the books of short stories. I feel like it would set the Ciri story line. Otherwise cramming to novels into a season doesn’t make since to me.
Hopefully the author accepts royalty payments this time :p
Looks like the perfect time to post my [fancast chart](https://i.redd.it/wcqrc34rsik01.png) for who I personally think could play certain characters, based off age, looks, acting ability and likelihood to appear in a Netflix TV production. Any thoughts?
Eva Green as Yennefer please.
Oh no.... I don't think a live adaptation would fit the series, but I could be wrong. I only see the Geralt from the video games. Assassin's Creed movie didn't do it for me either. :/ 2020 will be here soon enough 
The Witcher 3 has a book series? I thought that masterpiece was made entirely by CDPR?
There is already a Witcher TV series.

[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1070742/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1070742/)
Has anyone seen the writer's tweets? This show will suck
[deleted]
I was really surprised when Castlevania was decent. Now we'll get to see if they can turn a game into a live action show, though I guess being based on the books could make it more than another video game adaptation. I'm not a Witcher fan but I'm definitely curious.
Do the books have the same kind of teenage power fantasy vibe that the games give off? I.E. super-cool brooding dude who's an outcast because of his awesome powers and glib attitude, who despite his "curse" gets to kill tons of monsters and fuck the hottest women around? 
I’m just hoping this results in more Polish sci-fi translated into English.  It’s huge in Poland but virtually none of it is available in English.
So only the pilot is written (and not even edited), but they decided it will be 8 episodes? And new writers will come in. Seems like nothing is certain on the quality.
So a tv show is ok? Is the author sure about this?

It's technology again, like those scary videogames the author claimed did -nothing- for the popularity of the franchise. All because he was dumbdumb and didn't take the percentages.
Awesome. I hope Netflix gets woke and cast a black man to play Geralt. This will help to atone for the racism of the video game series.
I wonder how grumpy the original creator will be above these. 
who is gonna play geralt?

my vote is either ewan mcgregor or viggo mortensen.

if they do the whole thing in polish with original polish actors that has my blessing, too. there might be subtleties in the books that are better to do in polish.
huge show? I'm struggling to even think of a castles and magic style fantasy show that's above remotely popular, other than game of thrones..? 

or a show/movie closely tied to/based on a video game? 
99% sure they get financial advantages for it, the books are EXTREMELY popular in Poland, they probably get a bunch of free shit, easy access to cheap/free enthusiastic extras...
It's more than a gesture though, the story has many references to slavic stories/myths and most of the world setting is based off anything you'd find in these countries, so choosing anything else than Poland would be simply weird.

For Poland this is a great opportunity to finally have something of such a big scale happening in our borders. Can't wait for the news stations/newspapers to go *mad* reporting everything that will be happening, simply because our cinema hardly ever reaches international audience :)
No one actually said that they will film in Poland, they said that it will film in Eastern Europe. 
Even without the perks the Poles are undoubtedly throwing at them for doing so, I'd expect production to be cheaper there. Really looks like Netflix's budget will go a long way per dollar for this show. 

Hoping that translates to quality sets, extras, CG, etc.
I hope it brings much wealth to Poland like GoT did for Ireland.
Wish it was in Polish too. I play the games in Polish. I think the acting is better.
I don't know if they mean the real first two books (The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny), or the books where the main plot starts (Blood of Elves and Time of Contempt). The first two books chronologically are just collections of short stories, so it would make a lot of sense to condense the important parts into an 8 episode season, rather than giving each book a full season because there is no real main plot thread, but the stories do set up a lot of the rest of the Witcher. 
The part about first two books in season 1 is made up by this article, this has not been confirmed in the slightest
The "2 books" thing is not confirmed, so I wouldn't worry about that.

https://twitter.com/LHissrich/status/987488285244076032
Well at least it will automatically be better than the last time they tried a TV series.[ It's one of those so hilariously bad things it's fun to watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZlIMnIe9e0&list=PLCqqhiBn-OnYtvyKrX6u_hKipjFtxE-B4)
Im assuming an hour per episode.
Well when you think about how that's 4 hours assuming an hour long episode, and your standard movie-book adaption is 2-3 hours for a book its actually not that bad 
I think the whole "first 2 books" thing is misinterpreted. Maybe the series is based on the first 2 books but will span several seasons. But we really have no idea until it's closer to release.
>the quality of writing

Based on the character descriptions posted on twitter by one of the writers of the pilot: not very good. 
If you're a big fan of the witcher, the show can be a steaming pile of shit and you'd still find enjoyment in it. At least that's how I feel. I'd take a shit witcher show over no witcher show any day of the week 
To be fair the game plot for all the games is pretty great. Perfect world would be them getting enough seasons to cover the books and the game. 
They could get to the games after the books are all done if they adjust some things. Iirc the games are set after and ignore some elements of the books.
I didn't like the games, but I hear the books talked about a lot. Are they great as a standalone, if I don't care about the games themselves?
What do we do for 2 years?
I want to congratulate you for properly (? I'm assuming) spelling name of the dragon Three Black Birds. 

I completely disagree with Eternal Flame, I do want to see it included for the Dandelion's ballad. Preferrably merged with some other story because it might be too short for full episode.

I also want to see the one with the devil purely for the punchline. :)
I think they will keep Voice of Reason. It's a nice little framing device and the showrunner talked on Twitter how much she loves Geralt interactions with Lola.

All the Ciri-related stories plus The Witcher and The Last Wish are pretty much guaranteed. Bounds of Reason is probably also guaranteed to be in, because it's so good. 
I just want as much goddamn Dandelion as possible in this show. Everyone always glosses over his character, and he is the best.
No, he’s the author that criticizes the games and gives them absolutely no thanks for the sudden increase of sales in his books.
It’s only a year and some change away...but I’m still upset 2020?!?!?!...2020!!!!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
He was awesome on Black Sails. I think he would be a pretty good Geralt.
Anson Mount or bust. McGowan looks too goofy.
Nah, Nikolai-Coster Waldau (spelling?) is absolutely the correct choice for Geralt. He’s handsome, has a good voice, and as the last season or two of GoT has shown, he is rocking the fuck out of the ‘salt n pepper’ look.
No one said anything about planning to do the first two books on one season, this article is full of shit. This is not confirmed in the slightest.
Where does it say they intend to include Bonhart in the first season?
Maybe it’ll be like several AMC shows where the first season is short, but if it’s a hit, the subsequent seasons are longer.
Search for "The Hexer"
Whats wrong with this role?
I was thinking Anson Mount from Hell on Wheels
watch clips of him from the 100. everything about his roll as King Rowan feels totally inspired by Geralt.
People said Heath Ledger was a horrible pick for the Joker too. If someone was a quality actor in their previous roles I think we deserve to give them a shot at any future ones. 
I'm just not sure I'll be able to see him as anything but the sex addicted dude from Shameless. I really hope that doesn't ruin it for me.
His voice and stature fit in well. If you observe how he carries himself and his walk, stride, fighting style in Black Sails and the 100 it's very reminiscent of Geralt in many ways.
The books have the same characters and setting, but the games are sequels to the books so the story will be different. 
The games capture the spirit of the books quite well most of the time.  The third game comes closest, since it's a continuation of the storyline of the novels.
They are short stories compilation so it’s easier to adapt 
It's not just Netflix, though. The series is mainly produced by the Sean Daniel Company, who did The Expanse, and Platige Image, who did computer animated cinematics for the video games.
"Why is Triss' hair brown?"

"Where's Triss?"

"Why is Ciri a child?"

"Why doesn't Geralt have a beard?

"When are we gonna see the Bloody Baron?"

etc.
He's actually working on the show 
I hate to say it as I love Eva Green, but she is too old to play Yennefer at this point. She'll be nearly 40 by the time the first season rolls around.
The hostess from West World; shes kinda sultry and sassy like Yennefer
It's based on an epic fantasy series with like, 10 books 
Yeah, we don't talk about that one in Poland.
Oh yeah let's get a 60yr old to play a 30-40yr old looking fighter with superhumanly fast reflexes, speed, acrobatics and more. Great idea.
It's in no way a game adaptation. At all. It's based off the books and only the books, and the game happens to also be based off the books. The game and show are in no way related in terms of an adaptation.
To be fair, Castlevania really struggled for about a fourth of it’s season. The second half of episode 1, to halfway through episode 2 is a dumpster fire of middle-school edgelord mentality.
The show doesn't have anything to do with the games, do how cane you compare it to some game adaptations?
Not really no. They are more of a moralistic tales about the nature of evil. Well, at least the first two short story collections are. As the overarching plot starts in the third book, it becomes slightly more conventional fantasy saga, but I never got a "power fantasy" vibe from it.
The books aren't like that and I'd also argue neither are the games; seems like a broad oversimplification of the narrative, themes and character. 
yikes
Just like (almost) all the shows out there. Of course they decide how many episodes there will be in advance and that there will be a writer's room (which most shows have). Nothing to get worry about at this point.
The episodes are based on short stories that are more or less unrelated, so it doesn't really matter.

There are about 16 stories in the 2 books, my assumption is they will do the 8 most important for setting up the main series. But again, the stories are more or less unrelated so every episode will be stand alone thing 
you should read more into it, cause there is a reason why did not take it
The racism against elves and other non-humans?  How the fuck is casting a black man supposed to atone for that? 
Racism is a huge theme in the series. There's multiple instances of ethnic cleansing..

I know you are just trying to be edgy but I don't even know what you are trying to say 
Considering he helped write the pilot probably not very 
Both of those choices are bad. It needs to be a no name actor so you can actually see him as Geralt and not just the famous actor playing him. 
Clearly Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.
I've heard Mads Mikkelsen suggested before. I feel like he definitely has the look and the acting skills. Will be interesting to see who they actually get.
My vote is still Anson Mount
Zack McGowan hands down, looks so much like Geralt, can sound like him too. 
I read that as Connor McGregor, bus breaking hooligan.
I vote for Zach McGowan 

https://i.redd.it/cwu1z62v4pi01.jpg
>my vote is Ewan McGregor

I didn't realize how much I needed this until now
Aston Mount is who I've always wanted
Viggo is waaaaaaaaay too old. They should be getting a late 30s, early 40s at most actor. I'd even consider Ewan a bit too old considering he'd be nearly 50 when S1 comes out.
While I have respect for the original polish versions of the series, I think having the show's dialogue all in Polish would be a mistake.

They'd want this to reach as broad an audience as possible.

Nic Cage would be a solid pick
It’ll be a no name European or British actor. 
[zach mcgowan.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdjIXs9BEoi/?taken-by=mcgowanzach)

he's off Black sails and basically lives, looks and sounds like Geralt anyway


Mads Mikkelsen would kill this. 
Danny Devito.

Jokes aside I wouldn't be surprised to get someone more unknown than a big name actor. I just hope they don't make him wear a headband. 
Definitely Viggio Mortenstein
Mads Mikkelsen would be perfect 
You spelled Mads Mikkelsen wrong :)
Merlin, Arthur, Vikings, Army of Darkness, Lord of the Rings...
Well it will be based on the books.
Good thing its gonna be based on novels, not a random video game story...   
  
Game of thrones and LOTR prove that people love the setting as long as the quality is good enough, the world is authentic, the overarching conflict bombastic, maybe even gritty and dark, maybe sexy too.
enthusiastic enough to put out for the series?
Probably at least some form of subsidy. Often times governments will offer subsidies for filming in specific places or even for using actors from a country. For example, Canada does this which is why many scenes taking place in NYC may actually have been filmed in Canada and why theres also a huge population if Canadian actors/actresses. Not sure about Poland specifically, but Im sure there's something.

If you're interested you should read The Hollywood Economist. It's a book that discusses the financing of movies from the set to the screen and is rather interesting. (Note: I mean it includes both how movies are funded and how Theaters make money, even discusses history of how we got the theaters and chains of theaters we have today). It's pretty cheap and while I had to read it for a class I actually really enjoyed it and learned a good amount from it. Covers a wide variety of topics including movie funding and even sometimes specific companies.
Cheap everything probably, though my cheap ass Polish mom is not going to give anything away for free.
Right, but there's also a certain artistic logic to it. Author's polish, its kinda like filming in LA when something's set their, but obviously not an exact comparison.
hopefully lots of sexy polish women extras
I guess you could *technically* use some of the other Slavic countries and not have too much difference, but I'm glad it's Poland.
I visisted Krakow a couple of months ago, seemed to me your country is really on the upswing.
It will be such a drag if this thing ends up stinking
also its cheap as shit. just ask the GoT people
Time to go visit before the series comes out and it gets filled to the brim with tourists...
Actually, the Polish movies are played in dutch cinemas and doing quite well! However, this is mostly because all Polish people here are mad for them, not because Dutch people like them xD
Nah dude, I have traveled all over Poland when I was a kid.  My mother is originally from Lomza and we have family all over.  Vancouver would be just as good as a setting and in many ways even better.  The benefit of filming this in Poland is how cheap it would be.  I do hope that it leads to more films being shot there instead of Budapest. 
Kind of random, but could you suggest some good Polish horror movies?
Will be good when SJWs complain about lack of black people again 
Yeah that's called a gesture
True!  It could be a phenomenon like what Lord of the Rings did for New Zealand.
I don't know why people are down voting you, the whole series originated in Poland, so I'd be thrilled if the show was Polish with English subtitles. 
Polish and Russian versions of Geralt are the only good ones. English one sounds like Snake or Bale's Batman.
Pretty sure they are adapting the collections of short stories first, its far, far, far easier than trying to jump straight into the main storyline
Probably The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny. Maybe season1 is going to be some sort of monster/hunt of the week(episode?) To get the audience familiar with the world of the witcher. Then season 2 starts with Blood of Elves.
Well, if you'd bothered to read the article, it is the short stories. It even marks it as "an interesting choice."
I haven't read the books so I can't speak for their actual quality but 'Sword of Destiny' has to be one of the most laughably cliché names for a fantasy novel.

They even [made a joke about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2mz_D-GRQ) on Arrested Development 
I lm hoping the first season uses the individual stories to set up the world and Geralt as a character. But at the same time we get glimpses of the larger picture. War wth Nilfgaard, sodden Hill, Pavetta, Duny and Calanthe etc. The Ciri storyline shouldn’t be the main focus of the first season but it should be set up.  There is too much cool folklore and moral dilemma in the short stories to completely bail on them. 

My biggest question is how they will handle Ciri’s exploits with The Rats. She does some fucked up stuff. Are they willing to make their female hero a crazy bloodthirsty teenager?  Or will they sugar coat that time and make her the voice of reason/bail on the rats all together?
I'm assuming they will pick the 8 most important short stories for setting up the main saga and have standalone episodes 
what stands out?
Yeah. I do not have high hopes for this.
If you really think that way then there's already a Witcher show (and movie!), it's called The Hexer if you wanna look it up.

But, as a Dragon Ball fan and a ATLA fan I gotta say: I do *not* agree with you.
Good news then. [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1070742/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1070742/)

And it's a steaming pile of shit. Still, there's some enjoyment, so you're right.
Ah, here we have literally the worst type of fan humanly imaginable.
The only problem is that the books end on a pretty concrete and final note, which the games essentially just retcon to allow their story. While it works fine right now as the stories are in their own mediums, it would probably come off as pretty clunky if they were tied together in the adaptation.
It wouldn't make sense. Theres so many inconsistencies. The biggest one being geralt literally dies in the books

Plus the wild hunt in the games in nothing like the in the book. 
The ending of TW3 main was pretty meh tbh. I didn't like the Wild Hunt roster at all. Eredin especially, was so much better in the books

Ciri "fighting" the White Frost? How does that even work? The White Frost to the Witcherverse is like Heat Death to our universe, a natural end that comes as a result of increasing entropy.

It's like trying to fight a supernova or something.

I'm just glad HoS had a bloody amazing 10/10 plot to counter that disappointment

This is my opinion, and you're free to disagree
They are not related in any way with games, simply beacuse they were published like 20 years ago, many years before the first game.
Ask the Rick and Morty fandom, they probably came up with something with all of that downtime.
Wait for Cyberpunk news...
I don't remember which interview it was, but in the one I saw recently he basically said that the games were well done, just not his thing. I think in other interviews he said he didn't like the games, but that was probably just because he wishes he had charged more to let them make them.
I think he has a couple reasons to not like how the games went.

1. His fee was a lump sum. He didn't expect the games to do well and opted out of receiving back end. He would've made an absolute fortune. I can see how that'd make you bitter.

2. People think his books are like the Halo or assassin's creed books. That must be so annoying.
It's over a year and a half away actually. 

"A year and some change" makes it sound like just a little over a year
He played a similar role to Geralt character wise in The 100 and was great in that too.
I imagine Geralt's *supposed* to look kind of odd though. If he scares off most average humans but can attract sorceresses and *some* normal women, then I figure he probably has a unique but not necessarily ugly look about him that only some people with better intuition would see.

I don't think taking some drop-dead handsome man and giving him white hair and a few scars will fit enough to make him look scary to the average peasant. I think Zach fits in that he's not unattractive, but he definitely has a unique look about him too which could creep peasants out when combined with Witcher features.
No. They should stay away from using the main Game of Thrones actors. People would make way too many comparisons and would be hard to see their character as separate from that show.
Geralt isn't supposed to be handsome though.
He's been Jamie Lannister for over 10 years of his life. he probably wants to do something different.

> Anson Mount

Not familiar with the fella, but Googled him and I'm down with it. Grey the beard up, add a scar...
(http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Anson+Mount+Screening+AMC+Hell+Wheels+2nd+HfWvBAmF4M0l.jpg)
Too traditionally handsome. This is book Geralt, not W3 Geralt, he's not even supposed to have a beard.
I was thinking Gary Busey.
Yes yes yes 
He was great in the 100. I didn't have a problem separating him from the Shameless character 
More likely the people that read the books will be the ones nitpicking everything.

Good to get an update on this, I'm glad it hasn't gotten lost somewhere in development purgatory.

Good
Yeah but isn't Yennefer like 90 something? Perfect :)
Sure. I'm in over my head here, I just assumed the interest in the material came from the games being so popular. I would guess there would be some kind of acknowledgement, but I have no clue about the series clearly.
The show isn't out yet and has barely started production, so who knows? I know the books came first, but I'm 100% we wouldn't be getting this without the games being a success. So we'll see?
Eh...I think the games do make Geralt a lot more power fantasy esque than the books do. And I read the books after the games, so I don't think nostalgia or whatever has got me mixed up or anything.

Edit: Downvoted for my own opinion, /r/Gamingcirclejerk 
Oversimplified, certainly, since it turns me off to the point that I haven't played the games. But since all I ever seem to see of them is the sex scenes, and Geralt looks like a kid's version of a punk rock knight, I can't believe I'm missing much in terms of characters or story.

I mean, look at the guy. Skin-tight armor that's more like a super-suit. Two longswords (for dual-weilding, or does he just like to carry around extra metal?). Long white hair AND cat eyes AND the tough guy scar over one eye. Admit it: if someone walked into a Game of Thrones scene looking like that, you'd think the character was a pile of action-fantasy stereotypes held together with too many leather straps.
Yeah, definitely, typical operating procedure is they tend to decide how many episodes they're aiming for and they structure the beats and the rhythm of a season around that. It helps to know if you're working with 8, 10, or 13 episodes when you're trying to figure out things like pacing.
Relax he forgot to write /s
agreed.
2nded ! 

Eh. They're both good actors with a large array of work so it doesn't matter too much I don't think. No one sat through The Dark Knight feeling like they were watching Heath Ledger, they just saw the Joker
Fine, I'll do it.
Or it could also be a great established actor who is great at acting...

not a no name, but underrated actor
This would actually be awesome. Lighten his hair up a bit and give him the longer hair and beard from season 3 of Thrones. Nikolaj is a wonderful actor (one of the best and consistently underrated in GoT, in my opinion, as well as showing good range in films like Shot Caller which he waa also excellent in) and with Game of Thrones coming to an end, I would love to see him in a leading role that could get him more attention. 
I would've never thought of him... interesting
definitely Mads
He's 52 now though, he'd be approaching his 60s by the end of the show.
he is not very beardy though..
Forgot about that guy...he'd be perfect.
oh shit that would be perfect
I think that the Geralt that we can picture now thanks to the game is not the Geralt we are going to get.  They will likely move away from that depiction.
I don't even recognize the name but saw the picture and immediately saw Vane from Black Sails.  He definitely has the voice rasp lol
Flair checks out. He was great in Black Sails, too.
I have no idea how Ewan McGregor could play geralt at all. So many other actors who fit the role better.
is the grumpy big guy coming with him, too? who do we want to have for that? john goodman?

he did not watch his buddies die face-down in the mud so that this demon bitch could curse that town!
i honestly do not care much, i believe i would prefer a good polish cast for the entire series.

as for obi-wan, i was just singing along with the prequelmeme :P
Hopefully enthusiastic enough to get bowl haircuts as well.

"EXCUSE ME MASTA WITCHA! I HAVEN' MUCH COIN."
I have no idea but it sounds like the kind of thing that would boost tourism and bring in that sweet tourist money.
I would, but then again I am not polish.
i would.
Oh nice, saving this up so once I am done with hurdling the entrance exams I read this! Thanks!

The Hollywood Economist
They didn't actually say that it will film in Poland. They said "Eastern Europe". This article has a lot of assumptions. Also, no one said anything about the first two books being in season 1. 

Eastern Europe has some incredible landscapes so they could definitely shoot there a lot. There is many productions shooting in Hungary and the Czech Republic right now because it's a really cheap place to film a movie. 
also helps that Poland has pretty awesome geography, mountain ranges, etc..
Same! In all honesty, I wasn't expecting it to be so nice. Also coming from London it was incredibly cheap. It was bloody cold, though. 
Well, it is a proud country that really values its culture and traditions. Because of that, we have lots of interesting places to visit to appreciate/learn about history of the country and traditions.

On the other hand, Poland (mostly the older generations) is still way too close-minded to foreigners/different religions, too sceptic about change and our politics are nothing to boast about. 

It is improving though, albeit slowly. 
GoT hasn't shot in Poland. 
That's Croatia, ya spanner.
No offense to Poland, but it's Poland. It's never going to be filled with tourists
Hah, I've heard that this is the case in England as well. Because so many of us are stubborn to learn new languages and go abroad for quick and easy money grab, they can't really go to a regular, native language movie showing. So in the end it's profitable to drop in a polish movie here and there, as they can't really afford to be picky at this point.
Sorry, I don't watch polish movies these days. I'd say our cinema is in a pretty bad shape.

I do enjoy horror movies, but the ones I see recommended on polish toplists are from 70s/80s, and they will likely be hard to find/get. 

[Here's](https://www.antyradio.pl/Film/Duperele/10-polskich-horrorow-6506) some toplist I found that you could look into if you wish, but honestly? Just look away :)
or how Star Wars really helped out Tattooine. 
Poland isn't some weak backwater country that will boom due to a show being filmed in it, no matter the budget. Poland, GDP-wise, is better off than Finland, Norway, the entirety of Eastern Europe and the Balkans (excluding Russia ofc), Austria, Ireland, Denmark and *Belgium*. Poland is on par with Sweden.
Lol. Doug Cockle is a national treaure. GTFO for reals.
Yeah, I'm fine with him sounding like Snake. Snake is a fucking god tier voice.
There are *really* important plot points in the first 2 books that setup Geralt's relationships with both Yennefer and Ciri and the concept that they are tied together by a destiny out of their control.
That will be wonderful if true. Some of the best parts of the Witcher novels are in the short stories.
Doubt it. They'll adapt the strongest story first because they need to prove that the show can be a success, then they can easily go back to the largely independent short stories any time in the future. Unless they truly believe the short stories will make a better show they're going to go with the main plot first.
Fun fact: Its impossible to start a sentence with "well" and not come off as a pompous dick. But if that was your intention, well done. 
I really rate the books, especially the main saga.  
Some of the better fantasy fare I've read in a while, and the main character is strong, but not invincible, as so often happens in books like that.  

I highly recommend them, and think they're better than the games.
That’s true. If it’s any consolation there is not actual sword. It’s a phrase that comes up repeatedly throughout the book. “The sword of destiny has two edges, you are one of them”. 

Better than an actual sword of destiny at least. 
I initially thought so too, but the title is actually a metaphor for the theme of the book, rather a generic "Sword of Destiny"
You will find that a great deal about the Witcher and its relation to fantasy and fairy tales is tongue-in-cheek or deceptively cliché. Most of the stories revolve around slightly modernizing the approach to monster hunting using biology, forensic investigation, etc. The result is a fiction that treats fairy tales and monsters as mere intrusions into a human-dominated and very bleak world.
Most the book names are like that, they seem very pulpy and I haven't read them, but would guess they are fairly mediocre fare. Love the games though. You spend a lot more time in those than it takes to read a book and it gets you much more invested in the whole world.
I always looked at the Rats bits as her being caught between a rock and a hard place and developing Stockholm Syndrome (quite literally, considering she's basically raped). Not to excuse the stuff she did with them, but I never felt she's evil like the rest of them. Or is at least as much their victim as their partner in crime.

Assuming the series is well-done (and even lasts long enough to even get to that point), when the Rats get their comeuppance from Bonhart ... it will be glorious.

What ATLA movie?  You're confused, son. 
oof.. I was almost ready to agree based on resident evil's awful, but entertaining film translations.. but then ya had to bring up that dragon ball catastrophe :c
[hmm.](https://i.imgur.com/EWxmP9e.png)
Yeah, the fan that enjoys something from his or her favourite franchise even if it's bad. Truly the scum of the earth.
I mean, game of thrones has had a similar thing happen in the plot, so it can still work out well.
I loved the main story, however I agree with your criticisms. Also, yeah, both DLCs had better story than the base game. Hearts of stone was particularly good.
Mostly shitposting. 
Ask ASOIAF fans m8.

Waiting since 2011.
Promised in 2016.
Probably released in 2050
 
:'( All I want is Cthullu Euron. Is that too much to ask?
CD Projekt Red offered him royalties but he declined because he believed they dirtied the name of Witcher
Yeah apparently they are very intricate stories with not as much action as you’d think- like he uses his Signs like once per book or something 
Never thought of it like reason #2, guess you have a point there. 
I immediately thought of geralt when i saw zach in the 100. now that they are making this show, i hope he gets the part.
I do get where you're coming from but I don't think Zach is the right kind of odd. To me, even in his serious roles, he looks like a stoner with kind of a squished face. Personally, it's hard to take him seriously in dramatic roles even though he's a pretty fine actor. 

Anson Mount definitely fits the third game's look more than anything else, but I mostly recommend him because I think his acting is top notch and I think he's bring a hell of a lot to the role. And as for being creepy, Anson doesn't really look 'creepy' at all, but he can be very imposing and threatening in a way that I just don't buy from Zach. 
Yep. Book Geralt was never the metrosexual beefcake he was depicted as in W3.
I think Geralt and Jaimie Lannister are different enough. I don’t think it’s fair to exclude someone because their previous work was in the same genre.

Ryan Reynolds has been how many comic book characters? 
I know quite a few women who strongly disagree with that sentiment. 

Also, I don’t know how into the male fantasy of “ugly guy romances the hottest women on the planet” people are these days. 
While this might be somewhat true, I don’t see how it’s relevant to how good of a job he’d do in the role. But i get what you’re saying.
I don't see anything there saying they're going to be in Season 1. When I saw those tweets a while ago I'm pretty sure she was just going through all the popular characters from the entire saga.
He really carried the show Hell on Wheels. The choices he had to make are kind of similar to Geralt as well. Some examples include "I'm not a gun for hire", his character Bohannon making a tough moral choice of forcing a guy who wanted revenge to leave town but that guy ended up being murdered (Bohannon didn't know though), and his physique/looks are there too. 
> Grey the beard up

Shave it off, rather. Geralt despises beards, and the only time he has one he asks for Dandelion to risk his life riding through a death forest just to deliver him a razor.
Lol I know but it's hard to imagine Geralt without a beard though. Even on the mass paperback, the book cover is the W3 game Geralt.
>The games are the (very amazing) games. But the tv show isn't based on them, at any level.

https://twitter.com/LHissrich/status/987418051313254400
Uhm what the fuck are you on about?
>Oversimplified, certainly, since it turns me off to the point that I haven't played the games.

Thats so fucking hilarious.

>Two longswords (for dual-weilding, or does he just like to carry around extra metal?).

Steel swords are for humans, silver are for monster.

You're like a 2/10 troll. Try harder in the future, theres plenty of room for improvement
Claims to have read the books and has no idea what the "two longswords" are for. 

If you did in fact read the books, your reading comprehension is so poor that the rest of your opinion on the matter is seriously called into question.
You *have* to be trolling. This is nothing like the books nor the games. With the games, you have to add something to do, hence killing bandits and stuff all the time. In the books they always seems to be traveling with the occasional bout.
Jesus, what the hell is wrong with you? What are you talking about?

The game has like 3 sex scenes (all of them optional).

You have absolutely no clue what you're talking about, and let me tell you, you are missing out.    
Was heath ledger considered as a legendary actor  before the dark knight?
That's a pretty much the best thing you could ever hope for an actor to accomplish. It's definitely not what I would expect, much more the exception to the rule and not the rule. 
Speak for yourself
Finally, thought you'd never get the message. Rejoice! 
Yeah, that worked out great for the Ghost In the Shell movie with Scarlett Johansson. /s
Geralt in books wasn't bearded btw. He did it let grow though sometimes cause of his style of life.
I'm sure by 2020 CGI beards will look flawless.
Book Geralt generally stays clean-shaven.
He can very well be beardy
He’s just joking about the r/prequelmemes memes
Zach McGowan from Black Sails would be my pick.
It's role, dude. ROLE. NOT ROLL. GOD!
There's a plowing monster in those woods. Folk be mighty afeared to leave their homes at night.
I’m really going to need droves of slack jawed bowl-cutted peasants in this series
Eh, it might boost tourism if the series is reaaaaally popular but aside from LOTR and New Zealand you don't hear much about people travelling somewhere because a movie was shot there.
Not to mention Romania and it's mountains and folklore which is very Witcher-like as well.
They already have a Witcher castle in Poland. I hope they use it cause that is just free real-estate.
Don't forget Slovakia with it's nature and plenty of caves.
Poland doesn't really have mountain ranges, it's pretty flat apart from a little bit in the south.
Was in Krakow last month it was 27c on the last day I was there bloody lovely!
Doesn't matter, just ask them.
Yeah I think Croatia was a location. Same continent at least.
Yeah, there is almost no advertising done, but the movies are always fully packed according to the local news.
Damn, Poland is just  [one rank above Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)) 

*You win this one Poland, You win this one...* 
Yet no one would consider Poland to be on par with Sweden for a variety of reasons.  Poland is kinda of a backwater, it lacks the standard of living that Western Europeans currently enjoy.  I blame this for both the destruction caused by WWII, the grip of the USSR, and the horrible nature of Polish politics.  
I suggest reading the books and listening to the Polish voice. English VA does not fit Geralt's character one bit, he's way to monotone and emotionless. Polish is much better, and Russian is not too far behind.
Depends on the game. In MGS5 his voice is less expressive, which I guess fits the character, but I simply prefer voices that have emotion.

Though, Snake has nothing on Geralt in terms of emotionless voice acting, in the English version.
man im glad ive actually read those two books before reading this thread
Fuck. I need to buy these books, like today ... don’t I?

Should I buy kindle versions or physical versions?
Yasssssss fury beauty and the beast!
Well water is often dangerous to drink if proper sewage is not applied.

Suck it.
Interesting sidenote: Its impossible to start a sentence with "fun fact" and not come off as a pompous dick. But if that was your intention, well done.


"Well done my friend!"
Is that dickish?
You're a fucking idiot. 
Sounds about right.
Did you even read the books? It sounds about right to me 
Can we have female characters whose secret core motivation ISN'T wanting a family, please?
r/lakelaogai
Can't believe they were able to use a real dragon for that shot. 
It’s not really the same situation. The plot point in GoT was both pre established and intended to progress the story, while in the Witcher it was intended to be a conclusion. 

I guess it wouldn’t be *that* difficult to modify to work as a bridge between the two, but you would definitely piss off some book purists.
Yeah, HoS had the story, and BaW had the atmosphere

Toussaint was beautiful, a perfect contrast to the creepy vampire theme (esp. Tesham Mutna)

Then again, I'm probably biased because I love vampires.
With WoT and ASoIaF, the only incomplete series' I buy are from Sanderson (Because he is a maniac who writes 3 books a year).
That's hardly a fair comparison. 

Green lantern was not a worldwide phenomenon and I'd argue most people only know him as Deadpool and don't even remember his other superhero characters. 
>Even on the mass paperback, the book cover is the W3 game Geralt.

Only in the US. And those covers are widely hated - probably even partially the reason for why the author rightfully gets annoyed about the games on occasion.

Also, it's easy to imagine Geralt without a beard. Here's him without one in [Witcher 1](https://i.imgur.com/XXTjdfZ.jpg) and [Witcher 2](https://img00.deviantart.net/a035/i/2011/145/3/9/the_witcher_2___geralt_portait_by_iamsointense-d3h79wd.jpg). Imagine there's a fuckton of illustrations and art around without the beard too.
So you've got no problem with the rest of the DeviantArt character design then. 

I don't know why you think I'm a troll. This is a TV subreddit, after all,  and I'd have to care about the game to want to upset you. I just wanted to know if the books were similar, since I assume they'll be the source material. 

But by all means, smash that downvote button if it makes you feel better.
I never said I had read the books. That's why I asked if they gave the same impression as the games. What was that you said about reading comprehension again? 

Jesus Christ, you people are so enraged at a slight to a game series that you can't even see straight.
I don't, actually. Though the fans here seem touchy enough that I can see why you might jump to that conclusion. And note that I didn't say they games were a juvenile power fantasy, I said they give off that vibe. 
I mean I don't think of the two aforementioned actors as legendary either, not no-names by any means, but not that I'd call them legendary either 
He earned cred with Brokeback Mountain as a legit actor, Dark Knight hadn't released yet when he passed.. 
Legendary, no. Talented, yes. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Watch Four Feathers
I remember a lot of people hated the casting and he was known mostly for 10 things I hate about you or Brokeback Mountain.
I wanna defend him with, "He'd been nominated for an Academy Award." But then I remember than Marisa Tomei actually WON an Oscar and then I remember that it's all bullshit. I think he was well respected enough before that though. 
What about the million other movies where established actors deliver great performances? 
She got mediocre direction. I think she could have played the character much better if the movie was just better. Sure, maybe a more androgynous looking actor would be an upgrade, but the movie still would have been mediocre.  
  
Most of the drama in america was not about her performance, but about her skin color. 
Well with or without the beard, Nikolaj would be great with lighter and the longer hair. Though admittedly, he looks more badass with a beard. And an really underappreciated actor. 
you got me!
Aaaah, went over my head. Perhaps his lightsaber skills would transition well to witcher sword skills haha!
Agreed
Thank you, I fixed! Maybe I was hungry...

Standing in doorways so Geralt can't get in without shoving; having their feet covered in mud.
Theres definitely some GoT tours operating in N Ireland and Croatia.

I feel like theyre probably not as big a draw as The Shire, but probably more popular, especially the one in Belfast, than Sex in the City and Sopranos tours were (are?). 
I've known a few people that went to Iceland because of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, and that wasn't a very popular movie
Yes! Romania has some of the most incredible landscapes I have ever seen. 
It's free! Real Estate! We're giving you land! It's free. We're giving you a castle. It's real estate. Free. Its a free castle for you, Geralt. This is free real estate! You gotta bring swords n' bombs, but the castle is free! Two stories, no strigas. It's free! You unlock the door to your free castle, we got you the real estate! It's a two story castle, its free, its got a training yard in the back. I'm not carrying this around all day! It's for your castle! Free real estate. I'll pee my pants. Geralt, come get your damn land. It's a free castle! Geralt, I got real estate. Geralt, does it get better than this? Geralt! The castle is free! Geralt! The house is free! Its a free fucking castle! It's free real estate.
Um, entire south half of the country is anything but flat, but rather system of uplands. Entire southern border region is chain of mountain ranges - Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains. However that's not the only one - there's also Świętokrzyskie Mountains, among oldest in Europe and looking pretty distinctly. Hell, even the north is not really flat, not in the same sense as for example Ukrainian or Russian flats.
they have the carpathian mountains, which are pretty impressive
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains
I asked and they replied that it was indeed cheap, cost them about tree fiddy
I asked one of the crew, but he said he knows nothing.
I've read the books.
relax nerd
I think an emotionless thick skinned monotone voice fits a mutant created to kill

I think i'd enjoy the dialogue in the game way less if he sounded like a normal village dude.
Just started the first book this week. No more thread for me. Thanks for the heads up. 
Damn good books
Whatever format you're more likely to read.
Well, dangerpus is always dangerous to drink. 
Wow, so you're so pompous you think you're too good to drink dangerous sewage water? 
Fun fact: otters hold hands when they sleep!
House of Cards and Claire, Veep and Selina Meyer, Unreal and Quinn/Rachel, The Americans and Elizabeth, Westworld and Dolores, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and, well, Mrs. Maisel, GoT and many female characters (from Arya to Cercei) and many other shows and characters.
Have you read the books? Ciri's want for family is easy to understand - her own family was killed when she was just a kid. And Yen cannot have a child, as most sorceresses she is infertile. But she still wants a child. Direct reasons are never stated, as I recall, but the motivation is not hard to see. She was born deformed, and was sent to the school because she had no chances of being married off. She has a fairly common female sensation of wanting to be a mother. And she goes on about the biological function of women once, saying that to have natural population growth, especially considering the high mortality, children need to be born once every year. That is, if I remember correctly.
So, we've all not read the books I assume?
There is no ATLA movie in Ba Sing Se.
Sanderson is the anti-GRRM 

1 book in 6 years vs 6 books in a year

The gardener vs the architect
Yea I know that Geralt doesn't need a beard it's just that I and maybe others would naturally want the actor to at least look like him, beard or no beard but beard preferred.

And the author probably was annoyed at first but has since acknowledged the games I think in helping popularize his books, counter to his first argument that it was his books that helped the games sales. I doubt he cares anyways, he's making money anyways lol
>
Oversimplified, certainly, since it turns me off to the point that I haven't played the games.

You haven't played the games, but spouting garbage because your a bad troll. Geralt just looks like a somewhat generic old dude in armour. The fuck are you even smoking

Try harder.
Maybe people just think you are a fucking idiot for harshly critiquing something you admittedly know nothing about. Just my two cents

It would be like if I went into a thread about American football and was like 'What the fuck do they wear those pads for? Are they trying to be edgy and imitate gladiators or something? And why's it called football if they only kick it a few times, that doesn't make sense. What's up with the lines on the field? Is that to help the players keep score or something? "
No, it's your attitude. 
The series is quite good, and I highly recommend both the books and games. Other than the political depth of both series, it's not really comparible to GoT. 

Both actors are inseparable from their most famous roles though. No one will think Geralt when they see a picture of Ewan or Viggo, they'll forever be known as Obi-wan and Aragorn. 
Um... have you seen my cousin vinny? She was a delight, it's not easy to steal the show when you're working with Joe pesci, and that's what she did. Strange example to give
She was fantastic in My Cousin Vinny, very deserving of the award.
Oh you mean in all the great video game to movie adaptations?/s 

Literally not a single studio has figured out how to do this right. I wouldn't hold my breath that some big actor could portray the role just because they're a famous actor. See: Fassbender in Assassins Creed. 
didn't this song win a Pullitzer? 
That would likely have more to do with the theme of the film and the beauty of Iceland.
Where both Viggo and Bunnicula are from. 
Then you probably noticed that Geralt is not a robot, he can be very emotional and expressive. English VA does not show that. His voice barely changes note. 

Of course, that's not the only change to Geralt made by the games to make him more of a conventional protagonist. In the books he's also not really attractive, while in the second and third game he is a very good looking guy. I don't mind it, really, but not only is it a deviation from the original, it also makes the character less special. While the change to the voice makes him seem less human - the exact opposite of the "witchers are still human" message that we get from the books.
Lol I was thinking that reading through that shit, and then died when I saw you had posted it
Except he's not emotionless in the books. That's the whole point - public perception of witchers is wrong, because they're still human. 
Oh man you're in for a treat I've only started the first of the proper books myself but it's an amazing story to read
.......thank you.....
> Cercei

Hehe
Sure, they exist in plenty of other shows but we're talking two of the major female characters in the Witcher, why do they both need to go around with a burning desire to have a family? 
He's not. He was approached by CD Projekt about the game rights back in 1997. He asked for a fixed fee upfront because he didn't think the game would be a success.

Turns out he's a moron. He's been salty about the games ever since.
*you're
That's ridiculous, for Ewan at least. He's done so many things, and no one ever refers to him just as obi wan. 
This isn't an adaptation of a video game. The video game is an adaptation of a book.
Well obviously you need a good adaptation to the original content to make it work. That should be first and foremost and that's where these normally end up failing.

You're saying if they were to give it a great adaptation they should still cast a no name in it because casting a seasoned actor would ruin it? lol
Three Emmys, actually.
I've read the books and english geralt.

He sounds like a man with plenty of emotions their just behind a wall. It's subdued not monotone
Personal tastes I guess. You can view different media as their own thing and actually get more enjoyment out of it instead of always looking for flaws. I think the english voice acting is excellent. I dont speak polish so the intonation and nuances would be lost on me.
I don't think he's emotionless in the game, just when dealing with people he doesn't care much about which is fittingly most of the time.
Because that's literally their character?
Triss has never mentioned children to my knowledge, and neither have any other sorceresses of the lodge.
They're pre-existing characters.  
Those descriptions honestly aren't too far off the book version. 
Most females will want to have a child at some point in their life. Your femenist idea of a women who doesn't want a family isn't that popular.

Edit.

Lol the downvotes. Most people want to have children at somepoint in their life. It's kind of built into humans through evolution.
Well, it's a bad writing. There are some problems with writing on Netflix.
Yea, but I meant that he's making money from his books and the deal with Netflix. Or I would assume he is 
Oh shit you sure got him.
Good point! 
Lol good point, my logic was a bit off track there. I'd honestly just rather see a no name because seeing a high profile actor as a character I already know is very immersion breaking. This is just my opinion, obviously. 
Yeah, to each their own. The books and the games are their own things, that's true. It's just, the character in the books was the one I loved, and it was somewhat disappointing to find out that people playing the games with English voices wouldn't get to know that character.
