Playful Startles

I kept waiting for the kitten to startle itself into the garbage can. 
I loved when my kittens use to play so innocent like this. Now they are grown and pounce on my hands with all 4 sets of claws and a razor teeth. Still love them though :)
Now he must meetâ€¦THE CLAW
Aaand that, in my experience, is what makes cats aggressive. They get used to your hand as a combat toy and later in time, when you wanna pet them, they attack you!

To be fair the hand does look a lot scarier when they do that.
Cat: "Lets play hooman, WTF how did your hand changed in a monster???"

Hey, d\_for\_dens, just a quick heads-up:  
**agressive** is actually spelled **aggressive**. You can remember it by **two gs**.  
Have a nice day!

There's always one of you. 
He/she is not wrong, though. This is how a lot of cats are trained to bite and claw. Then they are, sometimes, dumped for a new kitty and the cycle begins again. ðŸ˜”
