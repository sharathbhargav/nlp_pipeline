Death For Rape Of Children Below 12, Says Indian Government, Clears Executive Order

"But Your Honor, I swear, she said she was 12 and a half!!"
Curious, I looked up the [penalty for murder in India](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/sentencing-guidelines/india.php). Death is possible, but apparently reserved for cases for which "there are special reasons for doing so." While they do take into account factors such as age of the victim, death is not explicitly assured.

If this crime carries a guaranteed death penalty while murder *might* not, could this make some attackers more likely to murder their victim?

I'd imagine murdering a child in India would almost always result in the death penalty. However if it's not 100% guaranteed there's a potential loophole someone (capable of murder) might try to exploit.

I hope they will pass a similar law regarding murder of a child, and guarantee death if convicted.

Edit to add clarity:

The crime I'm referring to here is "rape of children below 12". 

I got a few replies making the good point that the killer would be charged with both crimes. Yes, that is true, unless they are willing to go a step further and damage the body such that rape determination is impossible. Yep, this is very extreme and uncomfortable to think about. I'm genuinely sorry for that. My argument is: any person who would do these things is probably willing to do what's necessary to cover it up. Not only that, they are incentivized to do so because of the potential lesser penalty.

So the loophole is unfortunately still there.

Sounds like a good idea... until you realize that it means a child molester is going to see this as a reason why they’re better off killing a child after molestation rather than leaving them alive, since the punishment is the same and they’re far less likely to be convicted if they leave no living witness.
A lot of people are saying that this would incentivize murder, and they do have a point, but looking at it from a practical standpoint even without the law in place a lot of these monsters are already killing their victims as the recent case of Asifa Bano shocked the nation, and there have been other such cases.

Fact is that law or not the perpetrator is always going to look for ways to not get caught. It doesn't matter what the law says if they benefit from killing their victim, they'll do it, and from what I have read, a lot of these people are actually killing their victim even without these laws.

When a little child is subjected to such things quite often there is a lot of damage both internally and externally. Even if they don't speak up a lot of times injuries are discovered by parents, that is assuming that injuries are not dangerous enough to be looked after immediately.

So all the people saying that this would give them a reason to kill the child, well they have enough reasons to do that already. What this order might do is remove some of these irredeemable creatures from our society, and maybe act as a deterrent.   
I think it is a knee-jerk reaction to the recent cases of rape which shook the country. According to data most of the child rape cases are committed by someone known to victim. Death penalty will put further pressure on the victim's family to not go to police.

A better solution would be to improve the criminal justice system, makes courts children-friendly and increase the conviction rates for better deterrence.

>NEW DELHI: The centre today signed off on an ordinance, or emergency executive order, to introduce capital punishment for child rapists, a move that is seen as an effort to signal the government's commitment to fight **sexual crimes against young girls.**

What about the boys?
Those poor 13 year olds.
If all witnesses were accurate

If all police were impartial 

If all judges were fair

If all attorneys were competent 

If all juries were unbiased and intelligent 

If all verdicts were just

Maybe i could support the death penalty 
It's nice to see that they are taking initiative to tackle the problem, but I'm not sure that it is the right way to do it...
Killing a child after raping is not an unknown crime in India. Such laws, I fear, can increase the chances of the tortured children to be killed. Rape can't be proved if the body is burnt or destroyed in such a manner. The punishment for murder is not death in 99% or more cases. Only "rarest of the rare" crimes are punishable by death.
Under no circumstances will extending the death penalty further justice in any way. Reddit constantly shares stories of people being wrongly accused of committing sexual crimes with lifelong implications and we can see from this that many, many people are wrongly convicted of such crimes as they are hard to judge. How many wrongly accused innocents need to die before people understand that the death penalty is one of the largest obstructions to justice there is?
Honestly, while any kind of rape or violence is terrible, it’s for courts to calmly decide sentences, not mob anger. The fact that a given crime happens to be reported in the media should not matter, if India is really a mature country seeking justice.
I don't agree with capital punishment, although this would be the circumstance that most tries that belief. 

Is there any evidence whatsoever that capital punishment causes there to be fewer rapes? I don't think there is (althogh I'm open to being disproved). What this does is make it about the perpetrator when our focus as a society should always be on the survivor and how to help them. Let the rapists rot in jail until the end of time; sincerely, I don't think they are worth the extra money and legal effort to kill. But can we care more about making sure the people who survive thrive?
Remembering the story about Vicente Benavides being exonerated yesterday, unless India has a very robust appeal system, this will lead to innocent people being executed.
I read somewhere that this isn't a good idea since the rapist now lessens the risk by getting caught if he kills the kid, the punishment is at least the same if he kills the kid.

Thoughts?
It's difficult to be objective discussing such an emotionally turbulent issue; however i believe that while death should always be a last resort when applied as punishment, the situation in India merits unusually strict and harsh punishment for sexual crimes. It's no longer a question of ideology, but rather necessity to by all means try to ingrain an aversion to all types of sexual crimes into the culture. 
My macroeconomics professor gave me a great explanation of why such a death penalty could be a bad idea, and it really stuck with me: 

People respond to incentives- if the punishment for raping and killing is the same as rape without killing, the criminal is incentivized to kill the victim, since it would likely give them a better chance of getting away with it. Withholding the death penalty for such a crime means that the legal system has something to offer for a criminal who leaves the victim alive. Take that away, and the legal system has nothing to “bargain” with, and murder could be seen as in the criminals’ best interest.

It is a very commendable step, but the real impact will be in correcting the state of education, as long as there are uneducated people in the country, such crime will continue to exist.
Goddammit, Reddit has become a shithole.

Well, it always was, but still.
What about the wrongly convicted? Ought they die?

Hey /u/Johnny_W94,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
> Death For Rape Of Children Below 12, Says Government, Clears Executive Order


Maybe I’m just nitpicking here, but isn’t having sex with a child under 12 years old automatically rape? Why specify “rape of children below 12”? There’s no way a child that young can give consent..
*muslim world screeches in background*
So this is basically outrage porn - the law. 
Seems alittle harsh to kill the kid 
But that would require someone getting convicted of rape in India? Not gonna happen.
Great! Now how about for women? At least make marital rape illegal?
"Man, I really want to rape a 12 year old but now that there is a death penalty, i guess I wont" - said no child rapist ever. 

It is good that there is harsh punishments for something that is a truly disgusting act but I don't know how much it will lower the rate of child rape.  Culture around women and girls really needs to change to see meaningful change.  Or I'm wrong!
Can we send you ours - starting with Cardinal Pell
Oh boy, here we go again with uninformed people arguing for death penalty because "it makes sense that it would be a deterrent"

Guys, deterrence doesn't work like that: https://nij.gov/five-things/pages/deterrence.aspx
I don't know how I feel about this.
Death penalty? Do we have to bring up reasons why death penalty is not a good idea again?
Any rape of a child deserves a death sentence if proven, but emphasis on if.
Alright, I'll go against the circle jerk and just say; this is a stupid idea.  Killing someone for being convicted of rape is bound to result in thousands of innocents being executed.

Once I was talking to my MIL about pedophiles.  Her opinion was "kill them all and let god sort it out."

My MIL's best friend was convicted of child molestation.  Why?  Her son told the courts flat out that she did it.  The only problem was she didn't.  She was being falsely accused of it because her son's step mom hated her and convinced him to lie about it.

I told her, "(MIL), you are aware if that policy was in place, your best friend would be dead, right?  Like wrongfully executed for something she didn't do kind of dead?"

Kids are easily influenced, kids are capable of lying about something they don't understand, kids can accidentally accuse the wrong person.  Once that person is dead, they're dead for good and there's no taking it back.  You hate pedophiles and want them to rot in prison?  Fine, but at least if someone is in prison they're capable of being freed if exonerated.
Why are so many people obsessed with retribution over justice? Why are so many cultures revenge based? It's almost as if logic and rational thought go out the window and it's replaced by people frothing at the mouth praying for the chance to be the executioner.

Edit: Apparently simple questions are not welcome here. Thanks for the death threats you guys! :)

How about “Death penalty for Rape, Says Indian Government, Clears Executive Order” 
That’s much better. 

Edit: People preaching ideologies which sound good but don’t work. This is the kind of mentality which has given shelter and safe heaven to the disgusting animals we are forced to recognise as humans. 
How unfortunate for those wrongfully accused.
I'd hate to be a 13 year old in India right now... 
These laws will lead DIRECTLY to a massive rise in the murder rate of children. To the extent you threaten the adult, you threaten the person who the adult has power over.
Technically marriage around that age would/should be consider rape as well. It happens across the world and scriter laws like this should be in place. Muhammad had many wives, one which was around that 12/13 ages. 
ITT: redditors putting their emotions and personal feelings above objective research and statistics that suggest capital punishment is a poor deterrent.
Death for rape, period? Dehumanization isn't a joke. 
What about those who marry 'em?
Read SCOTUS' opinion in Kennedy v. Louisiana for a detailed discussion on this issue.  Part of the reasoning was flawed in my opinion (lack of a national consensus - that's why the issue is before the Court after all.......), but many points are well made.
Can someone help me figure out why a death penalty is worse than a life inprisonment in isolation? Death is quick and relatively painless(?)?
Good one. It shoulf be applied for rape of any age though. 
Often times when I read these articles the rapist isn't even being prosecuted or they conduct some sort of "fake" research to make it seem like they are invested in catching the rapist. So if the criminal is usually getting away with it anyways what's the point of making rape punishable by death? It's not going to scare them if they see so many get away with it? It doesn't really seem like tackling the real problem...
I would hate to be a 13 yr old there 
Why only below 12 and not for all age? There should never be an excuse 
Sexual abuse of children is often committed by a family member or family friend (at least in the US, I'm assuming it's not too different in India). My concern is, if someone is caught, people might be less likely to turn them in to the justice system if it was guaranteed death. They might just beat them up and kick them out. 

I mean, do child rapists deserve death? Yeah, probably. I'm just concerned that such a policy wouldn't have the effect of a statistical increase in justice for the victims.
All predatory offenses against children should be capitol.
Okay so we can kill them for raping someone who's 11, but not 12?  Not 15?  Not 20?  Are grown women not as worthy of protection?  Please someone try to explain this to me. Tell me why this makes sense.  I don't mean give me theory, but facts.

Secondly, does anyone trust a justice system to get it right when women are more or less sold into marriage, and women who accuse men of rape are ostracized if not charged with a crime themselves? Yes, it still happens in many parts of the country.

Does anyone really think that people of the lower castes won't be the ones accused and used as scapegoats?
If you're going to go all out like that you might as well just say rape of anyone.
Who else is against the death penalty as a moral principal?
Now if only they could do something about not murdering [two consenting adults](https://www.wsj.com/articles/killing-in-the-name-south-asias-badge-of-dishonor-1468861581)....
Given the stories I see of India on here (which I admit based on how news is, my view is likely skewed negatively) I have zero trust in them in actually getting things right. In fact I believe the chances of them putting an innocent man to death are probably high. 
lol this would be great if it wasnt legal to marry a 9 year old to skirt this law since marital rape is legal... fucking barbarians. stop parading your one step forward and 3 steps back.
And they'll go about not enforcing this law like they do with so many others. India's central government has almost no real power to enforce laws, especially in rural areas where the police have local, more tribal allegiances. 
Bout time 
Um, how about death for any rape? That's like saying 60 years in prison for the rape of red heads.
Chris Hansen walks through the door

"Have a chair"
Why only children below 12? 
Why is this just now becoming a thing?
Good. Now start patrolling better.
The EU countries should pass this law. It would be particularly helpful.
I think it should be for all .. not just under 12 .. what about 13 , 14 , 15 they are also children 
My damn dyslexia kicked in. I read: Death Ray for children under 12.
IMO if your that kind of sick individual you deserve the worst death possible.
Hopefully this idea bleeds over into some of their neighboring nations.

Folks raping kids because they're having a "sexual emergency" needs to fuckin' stop.
Sounds perfect. Can we get this in the US?
I really like this, I think rapists are the lowest of low let alone a rapist who attacks 12 year olds.
I petition for Harvey Weinstein to be extradited to India ASAP!
12 huh? Setting the bar pretty low there, India.
This is awesome and everything, but reinforced the need of due process.

I really pray that this stifles any future acts of rape, but I also hope the Indian court system does their due diligence to make sure they don't falsely accuse anyone.
i should go to  sleep... i was totally convinced that Death for Rape under 12 was a punkmetal band name amd was utterly confused by the rest of the title
Why not just death for all rape?
Isn't there something in the Bible about drowning child molesters? I'm not Christian so I have no clue. If someone wants to educate me feel free to do so. 
Won't they lose a good chunk of the male population?
Finally they’re getting out of the dark ages 
This is a terrible idea. Not because I would lose any sleep over a child rapist being put to death but because, knowing that they would receive the death penalty if caught, they have no incentive to leave any witnesses alive. 

Edited: Because grammar 🙄
It might as well be a death sentence in the US. Child rapist are targets in prision. 
Sounds great on paper.  The problem is I don't trust the government to be fair or abuse this.  I don't trust that a woman wouldn't use her children to make these claims against a man she had a vendetta against.  
Wow, so... this is insane and barbaric.
I ain't even mad.
The article says the minimum sentence is 7 years. So the death penalty is on option that I assume would be reserved for special cases.
Street shitters have better standards  for child rape than we do.
Finally India does something right
Just 12? India should give the death penalty to all rape
JUSTICE! This needs to be enforced WORLDWIDE.
I think life sentences would be better, but harsher punishment for crimes like this is always good, as long as they are being enforced. Find the guys who did this recently to the girl and make an example out of them and make it known to the public.
***India has a rape culture. It is the rape capital of the world.***

No, it's not. India has a huge population. Take US population and add a billion to it and you still wouldn't reach India's population. According to [wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics), the number of rape per 100,000 in India is 1.8. Compare that to 27.3 in US and around 17 in UK.

***The rapist will murder the child after rape. This verdict is wrong.***

Might be true. Death penalties are always wrong but before this verdict, every grandma in India was sharing posts on Facebook praising Middle Eastern counties for having death penalties in case of rape. There was no other way out for the politicians. Hopefully now, the rapist will think twice before going in.
So screw all the 13+ year olds that get raped huh
 What if they execute an innocent person? 

While I'm for the death penalty a judicial process is not without error. 
Like it's going to solve anything. People who are psychopathic enough to rape little children don't care much about what's going to happen themselves afterwards.

Besides, instead of looking and questioning the core problem of this kind of action by interrogating the offender, not much going to archieve by just killing them.


And there is also a risk to execute wrong/innocent people.
12 years or 12 lbs?

I wholeheartedly agree with this. 
Death should never be a punishment. It's always possible that the wrong man or woman is caught and executed before their name is cleared. Someone with power could frame people they dislike, too.

I hate rapists too, but I would never want death to be a punishment. Lock them up till they die, sure. But execution, no.
Downvote me to hell but the death penalty is a draconian institution and is essentially state sanctioned murder. And if someone innocent is wrongly implicated and as a result is executed by the country, then we have failed as a nation in that we fail to protect our own citizens. Yes, rape is fucking inhuman and depraved, but violence and murder has never solved anything. Criminals are either mentally troubled individuals who need treatment or some form of unwanted antisocial elements in a society, such as psychopaths or whatnot. But in spite of this antisocial behaviour, they are still human, and hence must be treated as such.
Fuck yeah
I feel bad for the person that gets wrongly accused and convicted...
Pedophilia and rape are both horrible and need to be stopped and I am glad they are taking action, but this could get someone who has been wrongfully accused killed. i hope no one gets falsely accused. 

"The centre today signed off on an ordinance, or emergency executive order, to introduce capital punishment for child rapists, a move that is seen as an effort to signal the government's commitment to fight sexual crimes against young girls."

Also they only mention doing this for young girls and not all children so they are intentional disregarding other genders who are also the victims of child sex trafficking and violence. I wish people would just help everyone instead of portions of society which are deemed worthy.
Dont kill them, use their organs.
Well if you use enough of their organs, everyone'll get their wish.
Now watch the conviction rate plummet because rarest of rare standard and SC judges don't like giving death penalty. 

Criminal law hai bhai, beti ka future marital rapist ke sat shaadi nahi, thoda soch samajh ke karna padta hai
Unpopular opinion here: I don't think death-penalty should be an accepted form of punishment for rape, even if the victim is a child. Rape is a horrible offence to commit but killing the offender is not reasonable. I understand why people feel this way but this is an emotional response.
If it makes the people happy, there’s no point in banning the death penalty.
Seeing people put to death by the state makes people happy... I don’t know if that’s fucked up or normal. 

Even if the person committed a serious crime it shouldn’t make anyone feel happy to see them die. 
Tell that to the guys who watched Joffrey kick the bucket
Jack Gleeson is not jeoffrey! He is just playing a character!
I’m talking about the character, not the actor.

The amount of stupid people who think Jack Gleeson is actually an evil person in real life confound me to no end.
I’m not talking about Jack Gleeson 
What a fucking moronic justification. Lots of things will make people certain people happy, doesn't mean they are always a good thing.
> What a fucking moronic justification

I think what you meant to write was:

“While I disagree with your justification, it’s your opinion and I respect it.”
ye
It shouldn't be a certain age, it should be death for rape of any kind.
How about we just extend it to any crime, death for anything. 
Well I wouldn't know about that, if you steal a loaf of bread I wouldn't think death would be a good punishment. 

But rape or murder is another thing.
If murder is another thing, why would you encourage it as a punishment?
If you murder someone it would be fitting with the same fate, you robbed someone of their life so yours should be taken as well. 

In my eyes murder and rape is unforgivable, or lock them up for good with no option to ever get out. 


Eye for an eye means the whole word goes blind.

^(inb4 some moron responds with "everyone except one person xddd")
Of course! 
But I do think the punishment for rape and murder is far lower than it should be, at least in my country.

Around 3 years ago a guy I knew got convicted of rape, 2 women over 18 and 3 under 18 and he got 6 years, but he behaved well and got out after 4 wich is insane...
And what about all the people who are wrongfully sentenced? 
Well it's a big problem.
"Shouldn't we try and figure out why these people do this? Nahhhh,. just kill em' that's waaaaay easier."
It’s complicated 
Yeah all this is gonna do is cause the kids to be killed .
Please do this in America. I'm ashamed of our wuss approach to crime here. Kill these fuckers.
Yes
Yup. It's an uncurable sexual perversion with high recidivism, why even take the chance? I don't even care if it doesn't deter, justice served.
If I learned anything from the #metoo movement it's that women are capable of lying for attention. In the case of celebrities it's for money and attention. In others it's women who don't want to appear as whores to their boyfriends/husbands and claim the person they had consensual sex with raped them in order to preserve their innocence. I don't want innocent men to die because a woman can just point her finger and have them executed.

It’s sad that’s all you took away from the movement, and not that there are so many thousands of PEOPLE (not just women) have been assaulted and have finally found the courage to speak about it openly rather than staying silent about their experiences. 
Does there need to be a movement for rapes? No. We have something called the justice system. #metoo is quickly being turned into a vilify all men movement that requires no inquiry to actual facts. Careers of men have been destroyed because some girl wants attention and slept with somebody but I guess regrets? 
The justice system frequently fails assault victims. It’s nice to have solidarity and feel like you can speak about things that for so long you were repressing and society generally does not condone talking about. 

There are always going to be liars, it should not over shadow that large amount of victims. 

I was assaulted, I was called a liar, but you know what? I’m not. I know what happened, and he knows what happened. He lives free and unpunished and nothing will ever change that now, but it was nice to be able to finally without consequence acknowledge that something happened to me. 

If you’re not an assault victim the movement is obviously not for you. Nobody’s forcing you to partake in it or read or even believe what anyone has wrote. I’m sorry you’ve obviously been scorned at some point in your life to be so suspicious and angry and afraid that you think women are just going around falsely accusing men of rape all the time. I hope you’re able to get over that someday. 
>There are always going to be liars, it should not over shadow that large amount of victims.

Oh but it does. 

I don't think anything. Women are lying and it is painfully obvious with the lack of police intervention. Get a goddamn rap kit exam and file charges. Why should a man be able to be charged with rape 8 years after the incident with no evidence whatsoever? It's no mystery why the justice system fails the false accuser. 

I think you’d be surprised how often that *doesnt actually happen*. 
The US has one of the worst approaches to crime of any 1st world country, and you want to make it worse?

You understand that people will/have been falsely convicted of rape before, and you support the unjust murder of these people by advocating for this impractical punishment? 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tah9KIKOiGw
Stop defending people that rape babies.

Where is your decency?
'Stop defending baby rapists' 

Great way to end the discussion. 

Someone raped your brain when you were a baby. 
What is your fascination with babies being raped?

A unanimous jury of 12 citizens must render the death verdict after an exhaustive trial where the accused murderer is represented by two highly competent attorneys and overseen by an independent judge who ensures a fair trial.

Why in the world are you saying the penalty for baby rape should be anything below the maximum? You are literally supporting baby rapists. 

I pity you.
While I agree that I want to see these people dead, the DP should not be used with child molesters.  By using the DP with the molestation of children, we are giving them the maximum penalty.  If we were to do that, no amount of crime could possibly increase their sentence.  This means that they could very well kill their victim and not get any additional penalty.  Thinking logically (or at least as logically as a child rapist), it would be beneficial to just kill the victim and leave no witnesses.  Having the DP for child molesters would essentially encourage them to kill their victims.

Additionally, SO usually are abused A LOT in prison (about as much as ex-police).  They would be tormented for the rest of their lives in prison anyway.

As a side note, it actually has a low recidivism (of course a large quantity of rape victims don't actually report being raped).
First off, this point has been repeated 100 times in this thread with no substantial evidence to back it up. It's a thought experiment, nothing more.

Second, said thought experiment was invented by [louis ck](https://youtu.be/grm3YUKmmhs) a known pervert.
Thank you government 
I hope that this type of punishment gains traction elsewhere. Violent sex offenders need to be removed from our planet. Prison is expensive, but a bullet is cheap.
Is it worth cost of occasionally executing people for crimes they didn't commit? Because that does happen, and will always happen unless we somehow create a perfect justice system.
I mean, honestly, it probably is. We'd still need to use due process and have adequate evidence to convict. I'm not advocating for lawless vigilantism or anything. However, violent sex offenders are often repeat offenders. They create far too many victims. Just roll the bastards into a ditch and be done with it.
Okay, at least you're honest. I think that's morally reprehensible. I cannot understand the logic of it - we execute those that murder or ruin the lives of others, and in doing so kill and the ruin the lives of more innocent people because of the imprecision of the death penalty. It's literally a net negative for society.

Would you really feel that way if it was a friend or family member who was falsely convicted and then "rolled into a ditch"?

You say "we'd still need to use due process and have adequate evidence to convict" - we have that now, and it isn't infallible. Juries get it wrong all the time.
I believe that you're incorrect that it would be a net negative for society. The justice system may be imprecise, but I doubt that it's as imprecise as you're arguing. Overall, a greater number of innocents would be spared, by taking offenders out of society where they can cause harm. The victims of sexual assault are far more numerous than victims of false conviction, and they carry their scars for a long time. The actions of a small number of sick people collectively cause a great amount of harm to society, and I don't think that that should be tolerated.
That's a clear false dichotomy - it isn't a choice between releasing offenders or executing them. I'm all for life sentences for those kinds of monsters. I'm not saying let them all loose, I'm saying don't kill people when the justice system gets things wrong regularly. Life in prison is bad, but it gives a chance for those falsely convicted to keep pleading their case.

If your wife, husband, brother, sister, son or daughter was wrongly convicted and sentenced to death, would you really think "this is the way it has to be so we don't let any of the real bad people off"? It's easy to be utilitarian in abstract, but the policy you are pushing would directly lead to the execution of innocent people who committed no crime. 

I also think you are placing far too much stock in the benefits of executing the real monsters. There is no evidence to suggest that it is a deterrent, and as I mentioned above any crime that would carry the death penalty would almost certainly be a life sentence in the absence of capital punishment. 
While you may look at a bullet and think it is cheap, the amount of money required to get near that stage is a huge amount more, due to all the legal stuff. We have to be pretty fucking damn sure about their guilt before we reach that stage.

It's cheaper to lock them up for the rest of their life, and also many times worse.

Also, with jail you have less of an issue when innocents are convicted as they can be released. Death is permanent and unnecessary.
Agreed. People who rape 5 year old children cannot be rehabilitated. 

They just sit in jail for decades using up millions of dollars. Those funds could go towards education and public services.
Take a step back, and consider that people's guilt is determined by the justice system. That system is not perfect, and people are incorrectly found guilty more than we care to admit. Your comment suggests that instead of letting people sit in prisons for decades, we execute them. The fact is, it tends to cost more to execute someone (at least in the United States) because of the long appeals process that is required - it will inevitably take years, with considerable funds expended in providing resources to the appellant, and funding the state's response. If you don't believe me, take a look at a list of executed people - many of them were originally found guilty many years ago. This is unavoidable, unless you deny those sentenced to death the right to appeal - which would be unjust in extreme.

If you support the death penalty, fine, but you need to be honest and say that it's worth (a) the increased cost to the taxpayer and (b) the certainty that an innocent people will be executed.
I've heard this argument before. The long appeals process matches your ideal justice system, not mine.... The way things are vs the way things should be.
And what about regarding potentially killing an innocent person? Or that the death sentence does not involve a bullet, but a bunch of chemicals so that you go to sleep but never wake up, which is more expensive than a bullet.
I agree with you. Just use a bullet.
Not the point I'm making. I'm not really making any points.

A bullet is a shitty approach because there's no guaranteed way to kill someone with it, there's always a chance the person comes out of it alive, but in severe pain. We view this as inhumane, which is why we try our best to offer a painless death even to violent criminals.
Which I don’t understand. Why do people want violent murders to be put down in a humane way? Do you think when they killed someone in cold blood they tried to be humane about it? Should be get what you give. 
So in your ideal justice system, once people are found guilty they are unable to challenge the verdict?

Also, you're avoiding the issue of executing innocent people - is that a price worth paying?
Its been witnessed time and time again; when these child rapists get out they go straight back to child raping. But Reddit seems to disagree, hardly surprising tho. 
That's a pretty shitty false dichotomy. The two choices aren't "let child rapists walk free, or execute them".
I didn't create a false dichotomy and I didn't say there were two choices; my point is that child rapists do not rehabilitate. When a child rapist leaves prison, they will go right back to raping kids. 
To everyone here saying that this will encourage rapist to murder their victims it's [already happening] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/an-8-year-old-girls-gang-rape-and-murder-trigger-new-outrage-over-indias-rape-culture/2018/04/18/15b66724-4254-11e8-b2dc-b0a403e4720a_story.html). This happened before the new law was approved. 

You also have to keep in mind that your culture (whichever culture it is) and Indian culture are different. The mindset and entertainment they have and you have are all different. There are a lot of things being considered before india makes a law.(our system is really slow) 
Indian system has a Prime Minister and a President any law being passed has to made by the Prime Minister and approved by the President.

And again culture does matter. I've lived in two different cities in India, Mumbai and Allahabad. I'm currently living in Canada. There is a huge  difference in peoples behaviour, attitude and knowledge. Some Indian men from India still act the same way when they come to Canada. 
Any child rape should be death if proven with DNA and investigation.
So if anyone is ever caught fucking a 12 year old, punishment wise, they might as well murder the witness and kid because they've already got nothing more to lose if they're found out. Doesnt seem the most thought out law.
The law is supposed to prevent people from raping 12-year-olds in the first place, smartass
Pretty sure life imprisonment acts enough as a deterrent without adding the incentive to murder the victim and any witnesses.
No it fills more anger among people seeing those criminals live on. Killing theme is a safe option.
Why wouldn’t life in prison act as an incentive to murder the victim? If the worst they can get is life in prison they have not to. 
I'm not one for capital punishment myself, but rape of a young child is one of those things where I wish we went back to the old days in Texas where we'd serve some wild west justice, find a tall tree and some rope, and we'd let them hang for a couple of days as a reminder of what happens when you get caught.
Death for rape of people above 0 is fairer. 
From one extreme to another. 
India is not playing around.  And that's good.  We don't need more people left sitting with easy meals and shelter. 

I understand crimes happen.  But child rape is most certainly at the top of the list of creatures we could do without.  Put em down.  I hope the states go with this to.  Just putting a random "please stay 300 feet away from all schools" sticker really doesn't do much
How about death for raping anyone
How about jail for people who commit crimes, instead of bloodthirsty revenge.
This is not a good idea. If someone rapes a child below 12, now he/she will likely kill the victim to get rid of the evidence. Heck, i'd kill my victim if i were a pedo, because i can only benefit from it and my punishment couldn't get any worse.
Like how in China if you hit someone w your car and they are crippled you have to pay for their care for life.    Or if you kill them you pay a one time fine.   Guess what people do 
Did they ever deal with that group of hindus who raped an 8 year old muslim girl? I believe this had happened recently.
I think they're still laying charges. 
It will be interesting to see if this will impact them, given that their prime minister has been accused of being a hindu fascist. I also wonder if this order applies to people under 18, I know in the delhi rape there was a person under 18 who served a very light sentence.
Do you how easily child witnesses give false testimony, and how easily they're coached and coerced?

This better be reserved for cases of overwhelming evidence, and if you take a note from the American judicial system, that won't happen.
What about false rape accusations? 
I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion....

Firstly, this is too harsh.  I'm not here to make excuses for people that rape small children, but this punishment does not fit the crime.  Secondly, capital punishment will not deter child rapists.  It could, however, incentivize a rapsts's silencing of their victim by murdering them.

This policy wasn't drafted with brains, it was drafted with hearts.  That's not a good way to make good, fair laws that work.
Pretty much my opinion exactly. The legislation has good intentions. But, really, its implementation is an entirely emotion-driven action.
All those rapists should be beheaded and their heads should be put on a pike and adorn the border along with those of Terrorists  
...or just kill them and be done with it.
Its not about killing, its about sending a message. 
If you make it known publicly that they are being killed then it sends the same message. No need to go back to the dark ages.
Honestly, people like you who are just looking for a reason to fall back to the most barbaric practices they can think of are more dangerous than all the rapists in the world. 
“Civilized men are more discourteous than savages because they know they can be impolite without having their skulls split, as a general thing.”

― Robert E. Howard


People who fiddle diddle with kids deserve it. Third biggest scum on the earth 
Yes, that exactly is the mindset that is much worse than rapists. "They're scum, they deserve it" is how you get people to participate in lynch mobs and genocide.
Alright now, settle down. He is not worse than a child rapist. 
They're still right though, "they deserve it" is literally how you justify genocide.
Alright now, settle down. Wanting child rapists to be killed is not akin to genocide of entire races or creeds. 
Yeah, you're right, but there should not be a death penalty, because thennthe rapists will just kill the kid to get rid of witnesses.
That's the stupidest shit I've heard in a while. 
how so? If the penalty for not killling them is lesser, then the rape victims life is less at stake.
I'm not saying you're wrong but perhaps it would be more effective if you explained why it's the stupidest shit you've heard in a while. Because at this point he made his claim and you basically just said "nuh uh".
It's just a false conclusion. It doesn't make sense. I don't feel the need to validate my opinion beyond that.
You don't have to validate your opinion but if you are going to chime in on the subject with nothing of any substance it's probably best to just not say anything at all. It doesn't help your case to just blindly attack someone without any justification.

> more dangerous than all the rapists in the world

taking it a bit too far there
How is that looking for a reason, not much looking involved. Clearly your a scum and don’t deserve to take part in our society if you commit such a crime. What should we do coddle the rapist?
Not putting heads on pikes is somehow "coddling"? You'd feel right at home in ISIS.


I’m not advocating that, I’m saying I’m not against that because when you do something that sinister, I no longer view you as worthy of civility. 
Because now with the death sentence the rapists will just kill the kid instead, since no living witnesses = less likely to be caught, and it doesn’t matter to them, since it would be the same sentence
You can disagree with the extremities in which he believes they should be punished, but to call him worse than all of the rapists in the world is literally the most retarded thing I've read all week.
> barbaric practices 

Raping children. 

Barbarism vs barbarism, WHO WILL WIN?
Pedophiles are fucking disgusting, we should just torture them to death.
im fine with this
This should be the law everywhere
Don't worry mate, people in real life would agree with you. Reddit just has this weird thing where they love to defend child rapists. 
People in india agree with you. Not westerners. 
Ahahaha, thats just not true, go out and speak to people about it. Now I don't know were you are from but in the UK, many people would actively support this or have no issue with it, child rapists don't get much sympathy. When Jimmy Savile and several other prominent entertainers were exposed as child abusers, it was not uncommon to hear people wishing their deaths (the living ones anyway). 
Not if you use your brain for a second and think what this leads to. Killing someone has the same or less punishment. (Murder does NOT automatically result in the death penalty). Killing the kid makes it less likely to get caught. Easy choice right? Now they will kill the kids after raping them because what does it matter - The punishment is the same (or even less) AND you're less likely to get caught.


That is why this is not the law elsewhere where people think about stuff for more than 2 seconds before kneejerking.
"not if you use your brain for a second"

You can't convince me of anything if you start your argument off with an insult.
Then you're a pretty bitch and should develop thicker skin
I don’t care to convince you, the facts don’t change no matter what your opinion is.

It’s also not an insult. Thinking about it would prevent posting knee jerk paroles like this. I’m not saying anyone here is incapable of doing it. I’m suggesting they do.
As if child rapists were hesitant until now to murder the children to escape a 10 year prison sentence.
So what should they do?
Nope.
I guess it's cheaper than therapy.
BB ft k
Right, but it's not a deterrent issue. It's not a hey yo guys don't rape or you gonna get hung or lynched or mob justice. It's hey we have an incredibly fucked up and corrupt system, so by saying we'll kill you if you rape someone doesn't mean shit if you don't get convicted in the first place.

Counting your chickens before they hatch. 
How about doing something about the underlying causes instead? This won't help at all.
Should be named the "Seriously bro" order, with the instruction clear that any judge must ask the defendant "Seriously bro?"
> NEW DELHI:  The centre today signed off on an ordinance, or emergency executive order, to introduce capital punishment for child rapists, a move that is seen as an effort to signal the government's commitment to fight sexual crimes against young girls. The change was cleared at a meeting of the Union Cabinet convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi within hours of his return from a five-day foreign tour.

> [...]

> When experts tasked to overhaul rape laws had looked into this demand following the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in the national capital, they had noted that capital punishment for rape "may not have a deterrent effect".
Insane that they put a number on it
Forgive my ignorance but won't this only increase rape on people 13+?
I'm cool with that. I'm sure we all are. Three cheers to India. Hopefully no one claims they were raped to have someone executed, but I'm sure the courts will sort that out.
Great start. Now let’s just get it to where all rape calls for the death penalty.
Death for rape* 

There, I fixed it for you. 
chemical castration is a more humane, cost effective punishment. in other words, just inject heavy hormones and antidepressants in whoever guilty.
Below 12? That is a strange line to draw. It should have been all ages until they get their act together.
While I see no problem with these monsters being killed... I'd hate to live in a country where my government has the right to kill me.
Me too, but I'd gladly accept it in this case
yes. more yes.
This is a despicable situation to begin with.
Sounds like a fair punishment to me. 
Doesn't mean shit if it's not enforced.
12 years old, no way!  At 13 your off the hook, just work on being patient.
This just puts a number on what makes pedophilia more extreme. I think this is going to make life harder on 13 year olds. Make them a target for the fucked up folks in pedophile society. 
watchout new teeners
Nice.
Umm how about death to ALL rapists. 
Public have to push government to take strict actions for every criminals, Police should feel pressure to put criminals in custody and collect evidence.
Must suck to be a 13 year old in India right now
Well, yeah...
India: keeping it classy since 600 BC.
How is this possible with the huge rape culture in India?
India leading the world,  Awesome
Took them this long to implement this law...
That escalated quickly.
Rip Indian rapists.
Jks y'all don't deserve an rip.
Probably a bad idea...
Bruh someone rapes a kid I will wreck them and happily go to prison for it. Good for India
Whew that’s a relief.

Happy 13th birthday Samir!!!!

I’m in danger
lol
wtf is wrong with people.  I don't get it at all. 
I love kids but why do people make it sexual?
Good. 
There are ministers who are murderers, most indians are aware of this, I don't know what can be done honestly. 
This needs to be a world wide law
Dear India: I like it.
Thank you! Finally, somewhere is heading in the right direction with regards to pedophilia.
Why under 12?! Why not just death for rape in general? India's rape statistics are horrifying and the people doing it need a real threat to stop them.
Because under 12 is a child. 

India doesn't have a culture right now that sees it's rape problem as of big of a problem as it is. 

It geared towards children, however, that's completely indefensible. 
Good point!
Am I the odd one for being opposed to death penalties, even in cases like this? Even if we ignore the small possibility of sentencing someone innocent or maybe the ethicality of killing someone who might be mentally ill, lifetime with some work included \- to repay the society as much as possible should be always better no?
I'm all for this if there's undeniable evidence such as CCTV or semen found inside, etc. (actually, death isn't enough,- - justice is torture *then* death). 

Just don't want this won't lead to those "oops" moments when innocent men get killed who were falsely convicted.
> justice is torture then death

No. No it isn't. 

Pain and suffering is not justice, in any case. 
IMO there are certain cases where it's justified. Raping kids is one of them. 
When you justify torture, all you're going is torturing someone. You're not somehow making it better for the kid being raped. They're not going to feel good about a man being tortured. 

Killing him, sure. There is some merit in that they can not hurt anyone else. Torture however, is useless. You're needlessly inflicting misery on someone because it makes you feel a little better. This is exactly what we're trying to prevent. 
Killing the guy isn't making it better for the kid being raped, either. Punishments aren't merely for justice, they're for deterrence. 

You can murder 5 people and get the death penalty. What if you murder 50? That's 10 times worse than 5. Why the same penalty? Torture is only only deterrent that I can think of to compound onto the death penalty. 
By that logic, you can get tortured and murdered for killing 5(?) people. Why not 10? 20? May as well throw a few rapes in there as well. 
For the same reason you'd get put in jail for 1 year for theft and 5 years for beating someone to a pulp.
Okay, so killing 5 people. What sentence should that give me?
I dunno I'm not a judge. I can't give accurate sentencing. My hypothesis is just that crimes that go beyond the death penalty warrant a punishment greater than death. Put it this way, as an extreme example: if you murder a whole family, you'll probably get the death penalty. If you commit genocide, torture then death is just. You don't get to have the same penalty as the guy that murdered one family after you murdered hundreds of thousands. Everything in between is nuances but my point seems validated.
This may incentive the rapist to kill his victim, eliminate the witness.
Death for rape for any age. 
I can support this. You behave like a monster you deserve to be exterminated. 
Good that the Indian government is taking child rape more seriously.

Bad that they think the death penalty is the appropriate remedy.
Seems fair...i say boiled to near death every anniversary of their crime/s
I wish we could do this here, it's well deserved.
If we adopted that here in the U.S we wouldn't have actors in Hollywood or politicians in Washington. I'm for it! 
Why this isn't standard is beyond me. 
This says to me that India is sending a message to the world. First, that any one over the age of 12 is not as valuable as a person, secondly that it’s somehow magically more acceptable to rape any one over 12 (which makes sense considering the reputation that country has for gang rapes) and thirdly that you should probably be scared if you are a pensioner becuase no one will care about you. 

Also, why 12, if they REALLY have to do this legalised killing with a statutory age cutoff for rape, then why not base it on the age of sexual consent in the first place, which is 18 for them now, right? Why is it slightly more ok to still rape underage kids between 12 to 18?

Messed up in the head and criminal is messed up at any age, age doesn’t make criminal rapists any less or more criminal rapists...
You should either have death penalty for the crime itself or not at all and actually try to work out WHY these people are so crazy then fix the root social issues for rape that the country clearly has.

Not sure India really knows what it’s doing with its laws.
We should kill everyone who goes to prison. Everyone. 
These people are disgusting. 
When can the US follow suit instead of having States that allow child marriage for rapists?
I don't approve of the death penalty in general, but reading the sort of shit that led to this, I can very much understand a strong urge for exceedingly severe punishment. So while I don't approve directly, I can very much understand wanting to murder the fuckers involved, but then in a legal manner.
I just wish this would solve the cultural problems in India that seem to be tightly entwined with rape and abuse. I cannot speak in detail of them as I only get snippets from whenever something is posted on reddit or similar, but it seems like there's a bit of a cultural view in certain areas/castes on how women are treated. 
I’m fine with it. 
This is saying that it's fine to rape as long as your raping a child over the age of 12?? What a terrible shitty place.
So now they will just kill all of the witnesses. 
Go india 
Good move.  Seriously, I'm sure there is some medical argument to be made about how neurologically it's not really their choice, but there is no data to show that any type of rehabilitation can help these people.  And yeah, I'm sorry that you were born with a predisposition to wanna fuck kids.  That wasn't your choice and that sucks.  But society as a whole has deemed it not ok to fuck kids, so you either never ever act on your predisposition, or you gotta go bud.
This only applies to lower caste offenders right?
Gonna be really scary when girls turn 12 then.
Change the "for" to a "by" and now you don't know what to think about it
It is a mistake to use the death penalty for any crime that leaves the victim alive, as this encourages perpetrators to kill victims afterwards, reducing the chance of being caught without increasing potential punishment. 
Feels like unintended consequence will be more child rape + murder. In for a penny, in for a pound.
Any thoughts /u/serverthreat? Do yo find this reasonable or bigoted?
FUCKING FINALLY!
Excuse my yelling, extremely sensitive subject.
can we all be reminded that marital rape is still legal, so all you have to do to get out of this is marry the body
I mean death is a pretty serious punishment but "12 and under"? Missed the mark. You are still awarded zero points.
Indians are smart
Death for Rape.... Why should age matter
How about death for all rapists?
I have an Indian man staying at our hotel who moved from India to New Zealand. He said the crime rate in India was crazy and he moved because he no longer felt safe. He said there are a lot of theives and people are getting more and more violent. He said he watched a couple of guys kill another guy outside of a restaurant because he was eating meat and wasn't sticking to a vegetarian diet. I honestly don't know how to feel about this
Given the number of child marriages, they must be making a distinction between forced sex and the marital sort?

If some dude marries an eleven year old who he’s never met, where does that fall on the spectrum?  
Good. 
I wonder how many people against the death penalty in the US are OK with this.
Anywhere in the world...money talks ...feel sorry for those who don't get justice...

When justice is served right...it's greatest thing whether it's in court or outside...

Cheers to the real heroes who do the right thing no matter what try price is....

Fuck the asshole lawyers who know their clients r guilty yet still find it comfortable to represent them for the right price...
If they're gonna do this then they should include the exact same punishment for infanticide.
I mean, kind of a low bar but progress is progress! 
This is a good move, by any standards. 

However, my own belief is that between the two variables contributing to crime - probability of getting caught and punishment if caught, increasing the first variable has a far higher impact on crime reduction vis-a-vis the second one. 

So while death penalty is a good move for a henious crime like this, what I'd really like to see is improvement in policing, investigation etc. 
That’s one way to control your population
Is it just me or does this title sound like the child that is raped gets killed? 
So i wonder what is the thinking behind the 25k people upvoting this?  Do they believe India didn't had any rape laws or rape laws specific to children? 

What's the point of having laws if cops aren't interested or allowed to enforce them? This is just a shtick our lawmakers come with everytime there's a new case that suddenly shames the masses. just pass more laws, that won't be enforced. If you read the following amendment, you can see for yourself how patchworky the attempt is. What if the victim is a boy? Investigations and trial happen only when the cops decide to believe the victim and register a case. In India, cops are more likely to not register a case, would dissuade the victim and her family from doing so and if all else fails, will try to arrange some financial settlement, just to avoid investigating the crime. Nothing in the amendment is acknowledging the biggest hindrance to justice, failure of law enforcement to register a case and open an investigation.  Nothing in the amendments makes it clear how and when the money for various forensics labs would be allocated. 

**Here are the provisions of the amendment in POCSO Act:**

**PUNISHMENT FOR THE CHILD RAPISTS: DEATH PENALTY AND LIFE IMPRISONMENT**

* In case of gang-rape of a girl below the age of 12, the punishment will be- death penalty or life imprisonment
* In case of rape of a girl below the age of 12, the punishment will be- death penalty, life imprisonment or a minimum imprisonment of 20 years
* In case of gang-rape of a girl below the age of 16, the punishment will be- imprisonment for the rest of life
* In case of rape of a girl below the age of 16, the punishment will be- imprisonment for 20 years (earlier 10 years) which is extendable for rest of life
* In case of rape of a woman, the minimum punishment has been provided to be 10 years (earlier 7 years) which is extendable to life imprisonment

**TIME LIMIT FOR INVESTIGATION AND TRIALS UNDER THE AMENDMENT**

* Investigation of all cases of rape should be completed within 2 months
* The trial of all rape cases should be completed in 2 months
* A time limit of 6 months has also been provided for disposal of appeals in rape cases

**RESTRICTIONS ON BAIL**

* There will be no provision for anticipatory bail for a person accused of rape or gang rape of a girl under 16 years
* Before deciding bail applications in case of rape of a girl under 16 years of age, the court has to give notice of 15 days to the public prosecutor and the representative of the victim

**OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE AMENDMENT**

* To help the victim of rape better, the present scheme of One Stop Centres for assistance to the victim will be extended to all districts in the country
* Dedicated manpower will be provided for investigation of rape cases to speed up the investigation
* Special forensic labs will be set up in each State/UT exclusively for rape cases
* Special forensic kits will be provided to all Police Stations and hospitals for rape cases
* New Fast Track Courts will be set up in consultation with States/UTs and High Courts
* Creation of new posts of public prosecutors in consultation with States/UTs
* National Crime Records Bureau will maintain a national database and profile of sex offenders which will be shared with states/UTs to better track, monitor, investigate and verification of antecedents by police
Children 12 and older can go fuck themselves. Or get fucked. 
Someone gets it right. 
Am I the only one remember the movie "Atonement"?

Good. Livestream it to the world. 
Good start, but I think the death penalty should apply to all proven rapists.
India, finally making things illegal that most people would never think about doing. 
Sounds like they have a problem. 13 yrs be like
Will the gang rapists be asking for ID now?
I'm good with this
Good vs evil. Its real and something we can all agree on!
India don’t play!
The really sad thing is: The net effect of this law will be an increase in the murder of below-12 rape victims. Not disagreeing with it in letter or spirit, just worried about the unintended consequences. As the father of a 6 and 8 year old, just the idea of crime itself makes me sick.
Cm or m?
Hopefully this will show people how serious an offense it is and lower that rate.
While I agree with the sentiment I fear this will increase the risk of the rapist murdering the child.
Me too.
Id prefer castration without sedation 
LOL I am sure it will only be death for men who rape children below 12. It will still be okay for women to rape children, just like it seems to be everywhere. 
This is bittersweet to me. I'm very anti-death penalty, but even more anti-child rape. Can we compromise at chemical castration for child rapists?
Won't be much help if the village mob beats to death the mentally ill drifter scapegoat who had nothing to do with the rape while the actual perpetrator evades justice because he's a local man of influence/wealth.
Seems fair
I love the imaginary moral line this draws on the border between being 11.9 years and 12 years
How quickly are death sentences carried out in India? Does this actually mean anything or is it just some symbolic bullshit like in the US where they get 38 appeals and decades of housing, clothing and medical care paid by the society that has already condemned them?
How death is not the penalty for any rape is beyond me. 
Honestly, you know what I don’t disagree with that law.
Every time I read a story like this I picture an asterisk somewhere in the bill and an attachment with *"also political dissidents" at the end

Of all the things the state shouldn't be in charge of, deciding who to kill is right on the top of the list for me. 
Wish the USA would do this... I'd vote for it
r/justiceporn
GOOD!!!!
You know, I can't say that I find much to disagree with here
I used to be for the death penalty. Then i got older, went to school, grew up a bit and read a few books. That all changed my opinion. I'm not for giving the state/government the power to systematically kill its own people. 
Aren’t people like born paedophiles though?
Death penalty is always wrong.
There's gotta be a better way to change the culture to avert rape than to just straight up kill people. 

Bans and punishment is what we resort to when we throw our hands up and admit we don't have a clue how to fix it properly. 

Yes, child rape is completely heinous and honestly anyone who rapes a child probably deserves death but it's not good for society to have punishments that draconian. Especially since it won't really stop people raping anyway. 
Seems like a lot more girls under 12 are going to get murdered by their rapist 
So the real question is why not just make the death penalty for every single rape case regardless of age? If that is going to deter people from doing it at that age then it should deter them from doing it at any age
Why not make the death penalty for drug dealers or car thieves or pedophiles?
Or do the old "eye for an eye tooth for a tooth" method
Isn’t that what they do for thieves?
Go India!
I know alot of people are against it but spending alot of time in r/india and hearing about child rape every other week or so you kind of end up feeling helpless and depressed against your country and any step is a good step right now for me, who knows hopefully we may come out with a better solution before anyone gets wrongly accused 
How about just violent rape in general?
Can't argue with that 
If anyone is wondering, child marriage does not get around this, though the age of consent is lower if married:

>[India’s age of consent for heterosexual sex has traditionally been 16 years except in Manipur, where it is 14. If the partners are married then a lower age of consent applies (13 in Manipur and, traditionally, 15 in the rest of India).(The Brothers Network, Zedenrecht)
>In 2013, the age of consent was raised to 18 in the IPC, for the rest of India (excluding Manipur). However, if married the age remained 15. (See the top screenshot.)
>However, in Oct 2017, the SC held that sex with a minor wife would be considered rape. ](http://indpaedia.com/ind/index.php/Age_of_consent_in_India#The_pre-Oct_2017_legal_position_in_a_nutshell)
Expat in India here. Little background on this story. Last week India saw riots across the country over the rape and murder of an 8-year old girl by two men both of college age.

As horrible as it is, it only highlights the increasing epidemic of rape plaguing India. This last week the Times of India reported that since 2012, the number of reported rapes in India has increased from ~24,000 annually to 40,000. Because of this report, Prime Minister Modi is under heavy pressure to react and avoid being seen as complacent or apathetic. 

I'm afraid this executive order will only work to suppress the issue until another horrific rape case emerges to shock Indians into further action. 
This is what’s really disappointing about being “human”; many of our kind will only stop raping and murdering under fear of death or an everlasting burning hell. Sick fucks. 
Wow! India is finally entering the nineteenth century!
If they're willing to still rape children after this new law, you can only come to the conclusion that it must be amazing.
A step in the right direction. Now all we need to do is actually acknowledge and catch rapists.
What an arbitrary number. Why 12? A 12-year-old is still a child by the standard of almost every developed nation. This should be 16 or 18. 
Texas used to have that.
The only issue I have with this is the fact that cases are rarely 100% provable. To execute the mailman for something that the stepfather did while leaving the stepfather in custody of the child and believing that the case is closed seems like something that will happen.
This seems legit. If a grown man can do this to a kid they should know their life will be forfeit. 

I can only wish that it would inspire the people that have these propensities to seek out help and counseling rather than risk follow through. 
I just met the most intelligent and mature 11 year old today. Im in America and he just came back to America today to be with his mother and older sister since his school year has ended.

    He told me he goes to school in India because American schools don't challenge him enough. He said his sister lived and goes to school here in America because its much safer for her than in India. 

   He told me every 24 seconds a women is raped in India. I wanted to bring up this law being passed to him, but wasnt going to as he js an 11 year old kid. After he gave me that statistic I thought itd be okay to mention the new law. He had already known about it. He said he wants to be a scientist but technical education at a higher level isnt good in India. He will get his higher education here then go back to into to help his country. 

   I asked him if he learned English from tv and movies or in school, he replied "I study 12-14 hours a day, how would i have time for television?" Really an incredible kid.

   
ONLY BELOW THE AGE 12 Is STILL SICK.  THE INDIA GOVERNMENT HAS TO  FIX THAT LAW FOR ALL KIDS TEENS AND ADULTS FROM ALL THE SICK PERVERTS IN INDIA. 
"If their age is on the clock" has never been more relevant
I like the sound of this.
"Celebratory gangbang with the victim and the police, when victim over twelve" says Indian government.
This is so needed, but I do feel for the few poor souls who will be wrongly accused and executed, because it could be any of us just as these poor girls and boys are abused. It is so sad all around but it is needed.
Right impetus, wrong conclusion.
Hide your 13 year olds. 
That's extreme. I understand the level of digust. No one can really understand those actions toward children. I argue that death penalties are not justice or vindicated, though. Innocent people will be killed by the government due to this decision. It also sets a precedent that is the opposite of what they're trying to accomplish. Facing and enduring punishment (like life in prison) for such crimes is a far better approach. 
I understand the visceral reason for wanting the death penalty for this,  but it also makes it so the pedo has nothing to lose for murdering the victim :p
why 12? just curious
You need to draw the line somewhere. 

An 18 year old guy having sex with his 17 year old girlfriend with her consent is also rape, as legally the 17 year old can't give consent. The family of the girl can file a case, and the boy will be hanged to death. Not everything is so black and white.

Also, I guess 12 is around the age when puberty starts.

5000 years too late
I almost misread that. Went from horrified to relief in a split second. 
What if you marry them before the rape?
You can't marry anyone below 12(the age mentioned in the title).
This is so stupid. Death penalties are barbaric and haven’t even been shown to reduce crime. 
Reddit is going from its usual anti-death penalty to strong support of this. Hypocrisy at its finest. 
I feel like I remember people advising against death as a prescribed punishment for rapes cause it tends to lead to more victims being killed...  hope it works out
We need this everywhere, anyone who rapes a kid sgould be killed
A step in a nice direction
I don't believe in death penalty, but at the same time I do wish for the death of those that commit such atrocities.
Good thing Russia doesn't have this policy.  Putin would have to be executed.
Good thing America doesn't have this policy, half of Hollywood would have been executed.
I have no issue with this.
You can no longer marry a 6 year old and consumate marriage at 9 because you founded a faith 
Mechanical castration would be a better alternative.  Let them live without their man or lady parts for the rest of their lives as a reminder to others like them.
Hell yeah we should have this law in America. All the kiddie fuckers need the chair.
I'm surprised nobody has brought up the fact that India has the highest number of child brides in the world. To me that is rape in itself. Why not work on that first, India! 
Because a country can work on multiple issues at the same time?
Uuh, I see no activity in that regard from the government. Why aren't women across the world speaking out about this. 
Child marriages are illegal under the law. Sex with a child is illegal. In 2012 a law made Marital rape a crime too. Legally, everything has been done for the issue. All that remains is for the police to properly enforce laws, and for people to become more civilized. I'd say they've been working on both fronts, trying to reduce corruption, and increasing the literacy rate.
Ok then, the government is in the clear then. Let's just wait for the people to see the light and become more civilized. Yeah, like that's gonna happen. This is the same country that still allows casts. I'm tired of people making excuses for shit governments. Time to clean up their acts. 
I don't know what else you want to be done. Discrimination by caste is illegal, and through education on its pitfalls,the younger generation is aware of this and doesn't judge based on caste.

All that can be done for these types of things is to teach the people why they're wrong. All you've said so far is that it's a problem, but you fail to propose a solution of your own.

You honestly just sound like a foreigner picking on the usual stereotypes about India. Just like everyone in every space related thread regarding India.
Sounds good until you really think it through, this will lead to kids being killed. IMO castration is the best solution. 
Castration has the same issue as capital punishment: there is no chance for recantation or for amelioration of the accused’s circumstance if he has been the victim of a miscarriage of justice. There are also a whole host of negative heath effects to castration; and, that’s not to mention the blatant disregard for human liberty evinced in the notion of nonconsensual surgery.
I like to think one's "human liberty" is forfeit when one fucks a defenseless child. 
By definition, one cannot forfeit human liberty no matter one’s acts
Eh...agree to disagree.
No, it does not sound good to begin with.
This is all good and well but doesn't address whatever it causing this rape culture. Of children, no less.
It must be some repulsive cauldron of poor upbringing, poor gender equality appreciation, over rating of base instinct over meaningful pursuits, shit education, bad emphasis of things that shouldn't be cultural norms in any half arsed society, awkward social habits when it comes to mixed gender socialising ad nauseum.

To most everybody the thought of raping a stranger is invonceivable. Joining in on one even more so. We have to question what might make this default cognitive state come about in the first place and why.

Rape is fucking bullshit. Raping kids means not that you must be put down but rather that you've no business existing in the first place.
It goes back to economic inequality and entrenched corruption... it always does, in these developing nations.
all pedophiles deserve death
The most painful death.
What about pedophiles who don't act on it?
I've seen a video highlighting India's rape culture in Haryana. It is very sick to see 12 year old boys saying that a girl deserves to be raped if she wears western clothes and goes outside. 
Uhm - how bout death for raping children period? :s 
How about no more death penalty and just a really long prison sentence?
Don't need to waste tax payer dollars on that- just kill them. 
This should be a world wide law
Uh how about no. Death penalty is abolished in most countries for good reasons
Uh, how bout yes! Let a few pedophiles get hung, shot, or brutally murdered and it will stop. 
Sure let's put them all in one pot and that sounds great for the humanity to torture and kill them like that.

>and it will stop

You're delusional if you think that's what will happen.. rape happens throughout history unfortunately.
That’s right, kill all the pedophiles. Society will be much better. That’s a no brainer. 
Not like they chose to be pedophiles.. it's the act on it that's the problem. Good luck enforcing that by killing all of them, surely this can go no wrong lol. A perfect society doesn't exist 
These people are knowingly raping children. How dare you say differently. No one is looking for a perfect society here but raping a child should land your ass in a casket real fast. 
Clearly they chose to be pedophiles! Are you crazy??? They make a choice to prey on helpless children. 
Dude. I think you should look up on the definition of that. People who are pedophiles have that attraction to them but it doesn't mean all of them also actually rape them. Not even majority does that. If they do then they are child molesters or rapists and that is also a choice then, yes.

Hell I bet few child rapists don't have that attraction but still do it because they want that pleasure and it's easy because children are weak and powerless and that of course is horrible.
Dude, you’re starting to sound like one the way you’re defending these shit heads 
I'm not defending rapists or molesters here. Try to read.
Bring back the gallows!
No.
WHY O WHY Cant the pussy ass courts of these great united states adopt something like this. 
Frankly rape is rape, to categorise rape in any way is rather silly, idiotic and shameful of the authorities.
If she's off the clock, she's old enough for cock
Why not just death for all rapists 
I have always wondered why we didnt do this in America. 
Because it does more harm than good. The death penalty doesn't deter crime, and if we execute rapists and pedophiles, then they have no reason to let their victims live to testify against them. It's a shit sandwich, unfortunately. 
I disagree that it would not deter this particular crime, the notion of the death penalty not working as a deterrent is based on violent crimes where the criminal was already likely a career criminal with violent tendency. However we do have knowledge there are pedophiles who do no act on those disgusting thoughts. So if were to begin taking these sick f@%s and killing them they would both be less likely to act out. If it saves even one child it is worth doing. 
👏👏👏👏👏
i agree but i guess i'm not any better i would like public beatings to be a thing... :/  
Oh believe me, I would personally be the hooded man if they let me. 
This is the law in Louisiana and but I thought it was already struck down in the US Supreme court.
It has less to do with serving as deterrent or solving the problem, it has more to do with satisfaction of punishment. A lot of people are angry at these rapists and they all want the severest punishment, so they feel satisfied that justice is served. Whether that is morally, legally or socially correct is a different question. 
Rape accusations are already muddied. Good luck ascertaining them, that too for minors. Probably a kneejerk reaction and with zero thought put in.

They'll end with a country full of dead Steven Averys.
 N
I can promise you this will not reduce rapes even by one percent.

Many convicts are roaming free in the streets and police don't give a fuck when the culprit is a VIP. In most of the days we have rape news in front page. This is the hard truth and people have got used to it. We feel for two minutes then we just go mind our work.

Source - I am an Indian
Not good. All rapes will becomes rape and murder. This has been debated before many times. And the final conclusion has always been that rape should not have death penalty as punishment. Otherwise there won't be any incentive for the rapist to leave the victim alive. For the life of the victim, rape wasn't given death penalty. This is a hasty and populist move.
The problem is not law or the lack of harsher punishment, it's the Indian sexist and misogynistic culture. This sick problem with the Indian society should be attacked as it the the source to all such problems, especially at the rural level. This demonstrates it well - 


 [Rape is consensual: Inside Haryana's rape culture](https://youtu.be/Pgom8LRF8hQ)
\*not rape when victims are religious minorities or low caste

\*\*BJP members exempt from prosecution
i'd favor life imprisonment. death is unnecessary cruelty and tends to degrade a soceity from being proud of being humane to one that is proud of being cruel. it also tends to increase legal costs. 

 but yes, actual rapists (specifically of women of whatever age) should not be let back in soceity. that has nothing to do with being cruel. the reason is it has consequences for the whole of soceity if women cannot feel safe from rape. 
Lol India is so fucked up
No argument here
There is plenty of argument if you look for it.
Not in my book. If you have kids you’d feel the same
The only problem I have with this is the chance of them being wrong. 
So nobody is ever falsely convicted of a crime? You can release a person from prison. The death penalty is a bit more final.
Good. 
That's the way to deal with mental health problems (pedophilia) when your economy is not productive enough (or you lack the knowledge) to hire experts and build mental health prisons like in advanced countries where death penalty is just barbaric and prisons are designed to resinsert criminals in society (scandinavian are the best with this).

That's why the US could be considered a third world country.
Gotta check those IDs before you start raping, folks
ITT: Americans who've never stepped foot in India pitching their opinions without knowing anything about the nature of rapes or rapists in the country.
To me it sounds like a simple way to get rid of unwanted people

Like political or business opponents
Dude kill anyone who rapes. Why the fucking age limit. Argh
This really just means a couple things. 

1) Innocent men will be executed along with guilty ones

2) Many rapes will turn into murders as well, in an effort to leave no witnesses due to capital punishment being applied. 
Yea, normally the opposite happens with fell good laws 
Meaningless because they don't have a functioning court and police force. 
This is called a police farce. 
Fuck the 13 year old rape victims.

Oh wait...let me rephrase that.
The law for that has also changed, with minimum punishment being 20years in prision and max life imprisonment.

An 18 year old guy having sex with his 17 year old girlfriend with her consent is also rape, as legally the 17 year old can't give consent. The family of the girl can file a case, and the boy will be hanged to death according to what you want.

Not everything is so black and white.


We should implement this worldwide.
Rape culture is very much prevelant in India.

When 7 year old girl was raped last week, her name was the most trending search in pornhub. Really pathetic
Great news. 
Apparently, you're a fan of kids dying? People will still do what they do in private in this very ethically diverse and economically stratified country. The problem is that when adults fear for their lives, they then want to destroy the evidence.
In the case of Asifa, and so many other cases, they kill the child afterwards anyway. If they know they will get the death sentence if they are found, hopefully it will be a deterrent. 
So what in your view would be a good step to dissuade these vile human beings from committing such inhuman crap 
As if they don't fear spending 15 years in prison and are not willing to murder the child to escape that. 
The ones that survive are just lucky enough not to die from their assault, not because they weren't allowed to live by their rapists.

In context of this particular situation, this concept doesn't apply. But this is unique to India's current situation, and hence doesn't reflect situations in other countries.
Good....? 
No.
[deleted]
yeah cuz we know harsh penalties work so well to deter crime...


What's your solution then? 
Properly enforced laws. 

Problem in India isn't legislation, it's the amount of shit that's not reported and doesn't lead to convictions. The corruption. Indian legal system is faulty, but it's faults don't lie in legislation, but implementation. 

There's countries in Asia i visited where drug trafficking is punishable by death. And they actually execute people. Guess what, it's still easy to buy drugs. 
Plenty of Aussies have learned that the hard way by not taking local laws seriously enough.
im from Asia, Vietnam specifically. Although what u said about death penalty for drugs is true. It actually helps a lot in alleviating the drug epidemic in my country. Only the major drug smugglers get the death penalties. Regular users or small-time dealers doesnt get penalty. Also, drug addiction in Vietnam is pretty low. The law is working as intended
read the comment by u/Deformed_Crab above.  
As long as this law is implemented, enforced.
Should be death for rape, regardless of age.
Take note, USA. This is how justice is done.
LOL Indian justice system is a big joke.
Meanwhile Europe is letting child rapists off the hook. 
Sorry, 13yo Indian kids.
Rape of people of any age should be given a death sentence 
What about all the people who get falsely accused? Are they acceptable casualties? Rape needs to be stopped but it's a complicated matter and something like "death to all rapists" will never work. 
I think death penalty should stick around, however it should be reserved for murder.  

As terrible as rape is, let's not forget that murder is the highest crime. 
Pretty reasonable.
Good.  Should be universal
Should get the same in the UK


Far too many children has been raped by scum, and there are far too many cops that ignored and allowed it.



So if you rape 13 kids you're good?
Yes. But it has to be a honor rape.
Death should never be a sentence when dealing with sexual assault cases. Only because they are inherently word v word. It is incredibly hard to prove or disprove rape. That is why so many rapes are not prosecuted and an alarming amount of convictions are false. This will lead to child rapes being prosecuted less because the standards for a conviction are going to skyrocket. This is a PR stunt with potentially awful side effects. Best case scenario rapes of 13 year olds will increase and worse case scenario 12 year olds can be weaponized. 
A child under the age of 12 will likely suffer very physically significant internal injuries from rape. We also have dna testing and I'm doubting condoms are being used here. 

Rape isn't hard to prove if you are a child and there is semen found inside you.

He said she said can only occur with adults because adults can consent to rough sex. Children cannot.

 I imagine the situation you describe should only occur with oral penetration but again, why would a 12 year old lie? No one glorifys being a rape victim in India. If anything you would rather keep it quiet to avoid the stigma. 
> why would a 12 year old lie  

Have you not left your basement for the last 3 years? People of all ages lie, and/or encourage or pressure others to lie for them for their own agenda.
Can't we just agree this should be a generally accepted law.   I mean wtf society has no place for sick fucks like that
Absolutely not. False convictions for all crimes, including rape, occur, so the possibility of people being unjustly punished to such an extent, throws this punishment out of the window, unless 101% concrete evidence is available (e.g. video evidence) to prove someone committed the crime.
Modern DNA technology can do a pretty fucking good job. If your dna is found inside a child you should die. It’s really that simple. 
In a perfect justice system death penalty is still immoral.
It’s funny because a LOT of the people here are defending them and saying that they shouldn’t kill those animals 
So better ask to see their ID first.
Best news post I've read all day! Way to go India! 🇮🇳
This should be the rule everywhere. People like this do not get rehabilitated. 
John Podesta
All those disgusting people that live in states where rapists who can marry their rape victims with parental permission would be scared to death of this happening here.
That's the right punishment in my opinion. 
Yes!!! I’ve been saying this for years! Those sick fucks deserve to die and the others will think twice about raping a child
we need this in the US
So children under the age of 12 will be killed after being raped? 

Seems harsh.
The death penalty doesn’t work as a deterrent, and if someone is wrongly convicted, it means an innocent person has died.

How about life in prison? Why not life in prison?
The cost?
How much would you pay to avoid a state execution?
Just want to point out that Ted Cruz argued for the same thing before the Supreme Court in the US and lost because the leftist justices deemed it cruel and unusual. So while you all celebrate and say "yeah duh", know that your side fucked that kind of justice up in the US 
Would be kind of cool if European countries would enact laws like this against child predators. That would likely encompass a large number of refugees, though, so probably a no-go.
You mean the white people in those countries who aren't having kids and who have high suicide rates, vs the immigrants who are having families and kids?
India is suddenly more progressive than every nation in the west.
How is death sentence even remotely progressive?
He probably meant it in the literal sense, it being an improvement/reform of the law
You're not one of those people who defend pedophiles are you?
What makes you think I am? All I said is that death sentence is not very progressive. That doesn't imply I'm progressive, that I support or disagree with death sentence, and most importantly doesn't imply ANYTHING about my stance of pedophilia.

It's not like there have been no laws against pedophilia in India before. They just want to sharpen them now. Whether death sentence is the right way to go with this is debatable, but it definitely doesn't fit (the western view of) progressivism.
Protecting children's rights
How about death for rape. Period. Open and shut case Johnson.
This is fantastic news!
Can we up the age please?
Burn the kids beyond recognition after rape, problem solved.

PS: acid works well too.

These idiot fascists will never cease to amaze me with their endless stupidity.
You're post is so confusing
Should be death for any rape. 
Ah yes, 12, that tender age of finally being able to be a woman?
Fixed this. You're welcome. http://imgur.com/vLeqvBr
Following this is a decline in rape of children below 12 years, increase in children going missing under the age of 12. Hmm.
Meanwhile children below age of 18 getting raped increased in number relatively.
"Questions?"
They are trying to distract from the real problem. Asifa's rape n murder is more complex than just pedophilia. There is a caste and religious hatred angle in there that they're trying to hide. 
https://imgflip.com/i/28tjdq
This is the sort of news worth sharing. Journoing 101. 
The people In the comments saying this is bad thinks rape is not as bad as murder itself.


Typical anti-muslim legislation from India. I hope Ben Affleck criticizes this. 

/s
Death for Rape is a bad idea. It'll incentivize rapists to become murders because the penalty is the same. At least with rape you're still alive. Don't let your emotions about a subject cloud your ability reason.
That country is just fucked up dude I can't take anymore news from them for a while 
Every country should have that
This country made it onto a list of top 100 places to live lol. 
Those 12th birthday parties are going to be bittersweet.
Simple solution. Tie the rapist to a chair at noon,... put the family and victim of the rape in a set of chairs in front of the rapist. Arm the whole family and victim with knifes, axes and guns... let them meter out their own justice. Put it on tv... I have ten bucks that says the rapist won't see dinner time. 
Watch out pedo lefties 
Torture would be worse than death—or at least there should be a harsh prison system.

Death is just the easy way out and costs the state a shitton of money.
Could potentially be unconstitutional.  No matter how you look at it, death is a disproportionate punishment for crimes short of murder.  Not that I deny the importance of additional deterrence in a country plagued by rape.
Sounds good in theory, but people can easily be wrongly convicted of this crime. And then, WOOOPS, they've already been executed. Oh well.
I'm a huge fan of the death penalty, but *only* when it can be absolutely proven beyond any shadow of doubt that the person is guilty. If there is any possibility they're innocent, hold back on the death penalty. 
Is rape a bigger problem in India than other places? It seems like every week there’s a new gang rape or child rape story from India 
Kiddie Rapist Logic: "Wasn't really looking to get into the kiddie rape-murder game, but I've got a better shot at not getting death penaltied if I leave no witness."
What an absolute joke.
But they don't kill rapists of any other age? FUCKING disgusting that their government literally seems to be okay with rape 
Stupid 

Now time for raped  children to be killed for a chance of not facing the death sentence, no reason to rape and let them live
Look out 13 year olds!!
How about death for rape? Those fucks rape so much it’s pretty much necessary.  
There is a Louis Ck joke about this.
“My daughter is turning 13 next week. So I should wait until then?” “Go for it”
"That guy I don't like raped an 11 year old."

As vile as rape is, the death penalty is barbaric and ripe for abuse. 
How about imprisonment for rape, irregardless of the victim's age.  Seriously, WTF?
Alright gents, 13yo+ are back on the menu!
India stop being retarded please.
This is why I'll never move to India, sickening country 
Maybe not murder, but castration without anesthesia would help. These guys would survive and let the world know that when you do shit like this, you get ur dick confiscated. 
Now, that would be a deterrent.
Should be death for raping a minor 
Girls over 12 years old need to arm themselves.  Maybe a machete and a couple of hand grenades.
Once you reach 12 though, no more justice for you.

If capital punishment is a choice it should be death for rape wholesale, why should older victims have to suffer knowing their rapists are allowed to live?
cool so now there will be an increase of rapes of 13 year olds
I feel like if you disagree with this... you're the child rapist
Good. 
I don’t like this. I would rather it just be a life sentence. I don’t believe in a death sentence for anything though 
Make it torture. Death isn't deterrent enough. Most of these rapists think it's the doorway to paradise anyway, so make the trip there a memorable one. Televise skinning them alive then rolling them around in sharp gravel and rock salt or something. Sear this nightmare into the minds of all Indian men, and watch what happens to the frequency of rape.

Barbarism should be rewarded in kind. Those who say it will only make rapists kill more of their victims... they already do that in most cases in India.
>Most of these rapists think it's the doorway to paradise anyway, so make the trip there a memorable one.

Are you implying most child molesters are Muslims or something?

To put this in context for American citizens; 12-year olds are 6th graders.
Please hang them...
We judge a society by how it treats it's least desirable citizens.
You need to legislate that....really, India you are the shit hole of the world. 
Can we make this a world wide law? Also if price is a concern, we have many large cliffs and a simple toss/shove is all that is needed.  
Yes, lets kill everyone convicted of rape, even those falsely convicted.
I will do it for free. 
Wtf.. death for rape. These should be no age clause
Wtf, how about no death for anything. It's a barbaric, uncivilized disgrace for any country that practices it.
What about when a crime was not only repeated but protected/expanded by the criminal's authority - in which case it's rare enough they even get charged in the first place - such as with that minister that had his victim's father killed, or ye-olde-catholic-priest-shuffle, or rolling back EPA regulations to maximize damage because that's not just making one rich but "helping god"?

I mean, sure you could hope they'll get a few years in some low security place after years of delays and appeals, and the entire time be living on the backs of taxpayers including their victims... but why not have them donate their organs until they've made as many whole again as they have harmed as possible?

Never say never?
Never. Absolutely never.

And how the hell do you come to the idiotic belief that people who've managed to evade justice due to various forms of corruption would somehow not evade it *just because the sentence is harsher*?

What gives you the delusion that it would not be those who stand in the way of such people who get executed on fake charges?
Yes. 
I’m sure many people will speak on the 13+ population, but realize this is great progress for their nation. 
But 12 is ok.
The more insane the method of death the larger the deterrent it would be.
Should be death to anyone guilty of rape in general, no matter the age, or at least get your dick chopped off.
Or your vagina sewn shut. No need to be sexist here. 
Yeah sorry, gotta check my male privilege...
That's excessive. For the record I don't think even this is appropriate. 
Why 12. Why not 16?
I'm assuming because of physical development. 
Many countries have different rape laws for different aged victims, I guess because kids start to be treated more like adults the older they get.
They have to make laws for this speaks volumes about humanity in general. I am not sure if we are any better than animals and even in their case, they only do things for survival, not because they twisted and fucked up like us. Sad. Sad. Sad.
Yeah I don't know about all that. Rape in the animal kingdom is not uncommon at all.
So 13 is ok to them? Wtf...
[deleted]
Below 12 -- before puberty
13 year olds in India just got put in a lot more danger.......
But raping a 12-13 year old gives you a month?
A good start.
This is great, hope other countries follow suit. 
I have no idea if it’s true but all rapists should meet this end.
Good idea. 
Finally.
Bring that law to the US asap.
Very good.
What? Why not all rapes? Why is 12 the magic number? 13 YO is as much a kid as a 12 YO. So is 14 and so on.
And so is 15 and so is 16 and so is 17 and so is 18 and so is 40 
Some of these hindu nationalists raped an 8 year old girl in Kashmir and didn’t even allow their father who owned their burial plot to even bury her.

What does that say about India?  Rape-nation
How bout below 18
Is it bad that i agree with this? It's intolerable.
Why can't America implement this?
And i agree. 
They are going to de-populate the country?
Says the joker with a rapist President. 
Well, where am I from? What do you think? xD 
nobody gives a flying fuck
I hope this includes women as well...right?
So people above 12 are not human beings? It's only a matter of time before ALL rapists are sentenced to death. 
What about Obama and Maggie Nixon. Where’s the death penalty?
Make it 18 you stupid fucks
Looks like Obama is going to have some problems following the recent Q...
Hooray Headed to India! .. what’s a ridiculous 

But only if they're below 12. I'm never surprised how backwards India is.
I support this but rape is one of those crimes that jails a lot of innocent people. I hope India makes sure that the perpetrators are proven guilty
Sounds great right....

How many innocent people will be put to death though?

On top of that, now rape just became murder since the punishment is the same. 

Shitty law
So teenagers are a free buffet then?
I don’t think the death penalty is the solution to this.
Why?
This needs to be adopted in the US for rape in general.  It may have the ability to prevent most rapes and also most of the scenarios when women lie about it given the punishment. 
Those are some high stakes. I feel like a lot more rapes would turn into murders if the punishment is always death.
So do nothing? I would say rape plus murder should hold a lifetime sentence without the option of living-free or parole. You have to do time and die in prison, there's no reforming this kind of mentality. 

And why is prostitution legal some places, but not in other places? 

Do we see people using less harmful drugs when pot became legal in certain states? Yes!

Just make social workers keep track of the sex-workers, ensure we're always there to help those who do it for self harm, and to give them options to get out, get sober, or live a different life if they so choose.

We need to address the issue even if we don't agree with the fact rape and prostitution is happening regardless.
I am just pointing out that when you raise the punishment of ANY crime to death, the stakes are now so high that if you are going to die anyway, you might as well commit other heinous crimes you otherwise wouldn't.
True, and in that case it should also be the punishment for murder.  Of course only  in cases that have undeniable proof, especial involving children, and we take some on the chin for getting a few  wrong.  
So 12 is ok?
Let me ask you something...

If John, a 6'1" 240lb man walks up to Jim, a 6'0" 210lb man and punches him in the face and walks away, he will get an assault charge, more than likely to be pleaded to a misdemeanor and walk out of country jail in the morning. Jim will wipe his nose, be really annoyed and go on with his life.

What do you think should happen if John does exactly the same thing to Jim's son Jimmy, who's 11 and is 4'3" 79lbs? Jimmy might need facial reconstruction surgery, be scarred for life physically and emotionally.

There are legitimate and valid reasons to draw a line based upon age for any crime and this question that you posed can be substituted for any age.  So 13 is OK? So 21 is ok? so 43 is ok?

What's your point really? What is the oh so clever thing you want to say here?
Would you rather this law weren't in place and even 11 were ok?
This just in: literally every child rapist just so happens to be Dalit and this was an excuse to kill them.

Edit: by “just so happens to be” I mean they’re not, but the government will use this as an excuse.
How about empowering woman not to live as secondary citizens so they have more power and protection of their lives.  
it is kinda SPACEY in here
I’m not for death penalty most of the time but I’m all for this
Is this really a good rule to have?

I mean, sex with kids is not good, 'consentual' or not, but death based on age seems.. stupid? so 12 years and a month is say, 5-10 years and 2 months earlier it would be literally your death?

If you're considering pedophilia to be a mental disorder of some sort, isn't it fucked up to kill someone for it?
Did you even bother to read what happened to the eight year old girl that was raped prior to your bleeding heart hand-wringing?

There is a link to it in the main article.

Thugs gang-raped an eight year old girl in a temple and then bashed her head in with a rock.

I’d say that’s a ‘mental illness’ more akin to rabies.

In such cases, it’s just best to put the animals down.
Well, no. My post was directed at the title "Death for rape of children bleow the age of 12" - Not a specific case.
We found the pedophile apologist.
I realize you're probably trying to be funny, but its a real question. I don't thing pedophiles IF they're mentally I'll should be killed for being mentally ill. Is that being a pedophile apologist?
In no way am I attempting to protect pedophilia. I am asking questions.

If pedophilia is a mental illness, is it ok to use the death sentence?
I have no well founded opinion on the first part of your post yet, but as for the second part: it would be fucked up to kill someone suffering from pedophilia if they ask for help saying they feel attracted but don't want to be.

But if they actually follow through on those feelings, that is another matter entirely that should be punished, hard. There is a difference between being it and doing it. 
Thank you for at least getting the point of my question.

Maybe OP title was misleading, but it implied tjat India made a law stating 'rape of -12 year old =kill them.'
Not a big fan of capital punishment. I can’t get past the idea that it’s a double standard.

An individual taking a life *mens rea* is guilty of murder, but the state doing the same is ‘justice’.  It’s doesn’t *feel* like justice. It feels like revenge, or at the very least, retribution. It’s more of an emotional response, not necessarily ethical.

Lock the fuckers up – sure. Try to rehabilitate them – fine. Look the other way as they get brutally done over by other inmates – ... I guess. That stuff happens.
Lol! This is always hilarious to me. You’re against Capitol Punishment, because you’re a humane person. Yet, you’re all for people being brutalized, tortured, and possibly sodomized in prison for the rest of their lives, because you’re also kind’ve a sadist?? Make up your mind.
Nope, I’m not *for* people being brutalised. I don’t *wish* it on them.

I understand that it happens, and, as an individual, feel that they are in a situation because they put themselves in, through putting *their* wants above others’ – obviously, illegal/erroneous incarceration notwithstanding.

However, a state should hold itself to higher standards than the individual. The highest standard possible. Trying to leading by example, not ‘do as I say, not what I do’.
I think that’s absolute bullshit. When it comes certain people, Psychos, Child Murderers, etc, anything should be on the table. It doesn’t make us look bad as a society. It makes us look like a just one. 
> Psychos, Child Murderers, etc, anything should be on the table.

That’s a valid opinion, as an individual. I just think Governments should be more ethical and less emotional.

> It makes us look like a just one. 

That would depend on who is observing.
Retribution and revenge are accepted forms of justice. 
My question would be *accepted by whom*? If it’s an individual, fine – that’s their prerogative to feel that way.

A state, however, should aim higher.
state, if not representative of citizenry, is what? who has declared what is “higher”? 
Ethics, public health, the greater good, whatever.

The idea that a state’s laws say that taking a life, premeditated, is wrong, but reserve the right to do so themselves is ... questionable. I’m raising that question, is all.



Yeah, no. One crime doesn't justify another.
Death penalty is never acceptable regardless of the crime commited, period.
By what authority?

Nature has no such rules...

If someone ever wandered into my home with criminal intent, as everything fades to black they should simply be thankful that I didn’t start snacking on them first.
Firstly, arent they supposed to hear voices and THEN it fades to black?

Also, eating monkeys is disgusting. I think you need to see a nutritionist bro ASAP
Yes, I would have done the same in that situation and I assure you that we are certainly not alone in that regard. Perhaps it's good that neither of us decides the outcome of the trial.

We have courts for a reason and we should not let the courts be tainted by populism.
How many innocent people are we willing to kill to make sure we kill all the bad ones?
So why is it only under the age of 12? Rape regardless of age should be punished with death...?

Man, India's population is gonna fall to like under 1 billion if this follows through. . . and I wish I was joking, despicable rape is high in India. I can see taking this extreme but at the same time how did it get this bad in India?
found le reddit India expert. 
Should be below 18! 
Considering the most common age of consent around the world is 16 I think you may want to reconsider 
Death penalty for anyone (such as 18 year olds) in a country with age of consent of 18+ having sex with a 17 year old then? Unless you mean rape as in not statutory rape? If so does it mean they are spared from death of their victims are 18 and up?

Yeah ok.
At least you can still rape 13 year olds, phew

Not funny actually. Why is this even a top comment
You have a valid point. India is actually moving towards abolishing death penalty. And actual death sentences are pretty rare (given the population). In many cases an awarded death sentence is reduced to a life imprisonment by the president (after an appeal is made to him). 

If the molester murders the victim, it can still be forensically proven that it was a case of molestation/rape. And I believe it will result in an additional (death) sentence. Though I’m not a lawyer. 


If you put the death sentence on anything else than murder, you´ll see a rise in murder, since you have a motivation to silence your victim.

This is something people don´t understand when they scream for harsher sentences for rape/kiddie fiddling and so on. You punish the victims.

There was even an oberservable case, where an american state did put live long sentences on kidnapping and raping minors. The state saw a rapid drop in such cases; believing it was a success. Only that few years later someone actually looked at the statistics and it became clear that the cases of children that went missing and were never found/seen again did rise about the same number of former kidnappings.

Nothing changed, the rapists just had a much higher motivation to silence their victims forever.
Raped and killed would probably still guarantee him death penalty, so no loophole. Except if it makes it easier to evade police in the first place
The rape charge doesnt disappear after you murder your victim.

>If this crime carries a guaranteed death penalty while murder *might* not,

The new ordinance doesn't carry a guaranteed death penalty. It carries minimum 20 years, or life imprisonment, or death in case of rape of girl of 12 years or younger. 


>I'd imagine murdering a child in India would almost always result in the death penalty.

No, the death penalty is only given in "rarest of the rare" cases. Most murderers usually receive life imprisonment, as the punishment. 
Wouldn't they be charged with rape and murder though? Just because the kids dead doesn't mean he didn't rape it too
Using brutal punishments as a deterrent doesn't work very well.

https://nij.gov/five-things/pages/deterrence.aspx
This is a great point. If the criminal has nothing to lose, killing the victim means fewer witnesses.
Bro most of murderers and rapist are fucking uneducated about constitution of india. Fuck they 'll even think about loopholes. These criminals are very wild and their actions, mostly, is impulsive which is dangerous. 

A man unaware of consequences or level of impact is a major threat to society. I believe lack of Education and their upbringing  is  the root cause. Indian is gonna take whole lot of time to change.

Death should be for every rapist.
The penalty doesn't even have to be less severe. Extremely harsh penalties for child predators merely results in more harm to children, because there is every incentive to kill the child, not because murder carries a lesser sentence, but because it's easier to get away with something if the victim is dead. A living child can recognize you, lead police to you, provide evidence to find you, testify against you, etc., but a dead child can do none of those. The problem of disposing of the body is essentially the same as releasing the child without somebody seeing you do it.
This was a Louis C.K. "Of course... But maybe joke." Something like, "*Of course* child molesters are horrible people and should be punished... *But maybe* if we didn't make such a big deal out of it they'd stop killing the kids afterwards." 
But also if rape then holds the same punishment as murder this will just result in more murders as solving a murder of an 11 year old is typically going to be harder than solving the rape of an 11 year.

Murder should always hold the worst punishment.

E.g. if bank robbery held the same punishment as murder why wouldn't bank robbers just kill all the witnesses?
We don't have the death penalty for rape in the US because it's easier to kill soneone and hide their body than to convince a rape victim not to report you.
Most children that are raped are done so by family or close family friends, so no they wouldn't commit murder to cover it up, they think their authority is enough to have the truth not come out...at least this is how it is in America, unsure about India. While I think this would be good for America as well we can't even kill our murderers on death penalty without it taking 10+ years causing heavy burdens on tax payers... Wonder if India has a better/ quicker system when  it comes to death penalty 
Youte baked af
It would probably make the rapist more inclined to kill them to avoid being caught if they didn’t know the victim. You have to remember though. Most rapes/ molestations of children under 12 don’t happen by an unknown person but someone the child knows. 
I just don't think we are talking about the same kinds of sickness here; being able to take a child surely is different than being able to murder a child, even under the fear of the death penalty. Even now, child abusers and rapist have severe penalties and consequences if caught and but still
 would rather bank on the victims simply not telling, very few resort to such drastic means to cover up their crimes. It just an unrealistic "loophoop" because child rapist ≠ child murderer.
Ive heard this is kinda like in China. Apparently they have some law that if you hit someone with your car and injure them badly, you are responsible for paying their medical bills for life. So to get around this, people have tried to get around this by killing the person they hit with their car. Pretty scary stuff.:
The reason why in most civilised countries (including usa) death penalty is not an option for rape is because that would incentivise criminals to murder the victim after the rape to silence them.
I think you're exactly right: a similar thing happens in, I believe, China whenever a pedestrian is run over by a car. Because the consequences are traditionally to pay the medical bills of the victim, the one driving the car often will choose to back in the hopes of killing their impromptu speed bumo before a hospital visit is even possible. 
I have a friend who was supporting this and I said the same thing. She’s Indian, she said that rapists will murder their victims anyway. Not sure how accurate that is but she said the methods of handling rape are different in the east vs west
Well that's fucked up, cya guys tomorrow!
Unless they rape and *then* murder. If they can prove that, it would be statutory.
Just because you murder the victim doesn't mean you're only going to be charged with murder. If you raped and murdered someone you'll be charged with both crimes and each crime gets a sentence (pretty sure but I'm not a lawyer) 
Well, whether you rape them or rape and murder them, you still rape them, so the penalty is still death.

India doesn't have the same 'litigation culture' of the US so legals don't really get as weird
I don’t think people who would rape or murder a child are considering the nuance of the law. 
While you have a point i’d argue that its quite the leap to make from rape to murder. I might be naive though.
I agree it's a huge leap. I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility, though. 

I suppose it just doesn't make sense to me to leave anything open when it comes to something like this. I'd want lawmakers to consider all possibilities and shut down any way to circumvent the new law. 

While 'all possibilities' might be a stretch, this possibility was the first thing I thought of when I read the article. IMO they should have seen it, too.
Unless Indian courts work significantly differently than our courts do, I don’t think murdering the child you raped abolished the rape charge you would face. You’d just end up charged with both the rape and the murder.
> 
> I'd imagine murdering a child in India would almost always result in the death penalty. However if it's not 100% guaranteed there's a potential loophole someone (capable of murder) might try to exploit.

That's probably so the rich Indians have a way to weasel out.
This was my first thought too. 

But then again, if they're raping kids, probably they were planning to kill them anyway.
From what I understand about prisons in India, death would be getting off easy.
Just because you murdered someone doesn't mean they got unraped. And for concerns over them taking the crime further since by that point they reasonable can't get in any MORE trouble now, I doubt the increased legal ramifications were really a huge concern either way. Either they had it in them to kill a child or they didn't. Death vs. life in prison is kinda semantics at that point.
That argument never made sense to me. Raping and killing/mutilating a body are 2 completely different acts that requires different minds.

If somebody has in him to kill his victim simply to not get caught, the odds are that he is disturbed enough to have done it regardless of the punishment.
Wouldn't you then be charged with both rape AND murder? 
The real problem is that this sentence structure will decrease reporting. 
To be fair no one walks around a kid and think “hmm, if I rape her I could get death penalty. Might as well kill her afterward”. Or maybe I’m out touch with reality and some people are actually this sick. 
Bro, most people who suffer sexual abuse are abused by members of their family systematically over a period of years. It's not a one and done crime by random people to random children. They are sexually perverted but they're not devoid of all morals so I doubt most pedophiles would commit murder and mutilation of a corpse. Especially when it is someone who is socially attached to them. I mean it COULD happen, but it's a slim chance.
But isn't that rape and murder you'd be charged for
Rape especially at a young age, fucks people up. If someone just kills someone off the street and not rape them, then it fucks them up less. One their dead but also they are not turtored with the burden of having been raped at such a young age, so in a sense it is less bad. 
This is the second reply suggesting that. I just don't get it.

If you had a young child and he or she was raped, would you want them to die?

Or would you do everything in your power to help them heal?
Yeah, making the penalty for raping some death typically doesn't lower the number of rapes that occur, but increases the amount of rapes victims who are murdered. 
> My argument is: any person who would do these things is probably willing to do what's necessary to cover it up.

I imagine some are but I think (not an expert) that a lot of pedophiles are very enamored with their victims and idealize them and also manage to convince themselves they're not really hurting their victims to rationalize their crime.  It would probably be very conflicting and difficult to also murder their victim because of that mindset.


> If this crime carries a guaranteed death penalty

It is not guaranteed I think. it just allows capital punishment.
> 
> 

A post advocating the death penalty with 2500 upvotes on Reddit. What is this, Stormfront?
The rapists willing to murder and mutilate a prepubescent child with the specific malign intent of being convicted for *only* said grisly murder are a much smaller subset of rapists. 
Whenever the idea of the death penalty for drug offences comes up, people seem to like the idea.  But it increases the chance of the cops being killed.  "I'm going to get caught for selling heroin. I could rely on the courts to sentence me to death, or I could kill this cop and run, and have some chance to live another day. I mean, I'm already pretty much fucked.  Might as well go all the way."
As a lawyer I can tell you that the "murder incentive" is precisely why most western jurisdictions, hundreds of years ago, abolished the death penalty for all but murder. 

Back in the day, stealing a horse or cattle was punishable by death. As you logically surmised, this incentived horse thieves to do-away with potential witnesses. 

The same holds true for rape, especially, I imagine, in a place like here where modern forensics is often not used.  

Sadly, this is a knee jerk reaction, and I do not think it will bring about the desired result
but wouldn't the rapist still have a high incentive to murder?by silencing the victime, the chance of being discovered shrinks.
If the assailant wants to rape a kid then murders the kid yo cover their tracks it rape+murder not just murder?
One primary objection to the death penalty for rape is that it provides incentive to kill the victim, as they are the primary witness that could identify the rapist. And if the penalty is no less than it would be for murder, wouldn’t it be best to eliminate that victim?

I oppose the death penalty entirely, but even if I didn’t, I would have serious concerns about applying it for offenses that don’t involve murder.
Indian Penal code is very lax when it comes to punishments. They even commuted the sentences of the people on death row for assassinating one of their previous premier of their nation. In any other country, they would throw the books and see through the maximum punishment possible.
Autopsy can determine rape though. 
Somewhat in appropriate, but Louis C. K. Has a bit where he points out that we would get a lot more kids back if we hated child molesters just a little bit less. It's very funny, but also unfortunately has a bit of truth to it. 
Slippery slopes! CAN'T FORGET ABOUT THOSE SLIPPERY SLOPES! GREAT POINT THAT WILL TOTALLY ALWAYS HAPPEN AND THESE INDIANS ARE RETARDS GREAT!
It also leaves the implication that raping a child is worse than murdering one. As if to say a rape victim is better off dead. 
> I'd imagine murdering a child in India would almost always result in the death penalty. However if it's not 100% guaranteed there's a potential loophole someone (capable of murder) might try to exploit.

No not really. If you simply kill a person, you are most probably not going to get a death penalty.

Raping and killing (with the new law) will do, as will simply raping the child.

Yeah people might just be more inclined to kill the kid instead of risking more I guess... But IMHO we should see how this pans out, instead of assuming that it will always work that way.
I mean the garbage state of the legal system in India isn't exactly an encouraging thing. If anything this country needs more death penalties given that the few people who do actually have a fair trial can be held as examples for who not to be
This is going to be very very controversial but I think rape should be the death penalty and rape/murder should be a different type of death penalty.

What's to stop rapists from killing a child after the rape? They're facing death penalty anyway.
This is why forensics and autopsy are important factors of the justice system, even though they're not a perfect science and it would be very difficult to dissect a child without any mental trauma.
> could this make some attackers more likely to murder their victim?

Sadly, depends entirely on the autopsy. If it was both, you should be punished with both penalties.
> I hope they will pass a similar law regarding murder of a child, and guarantee death if convicted.

Or... Just not pass dumbass orders that indiscriminately impose a penalty.

You can't solve social problems with harsh criminalization of the symptom.
> any person who would do these things is probably willing to do what's necessary to cover it up.

Willing, sure, but not likely. Child rapists and murders aren’t, generally, clearly thinking through the consequences of their actions.
No, severity of punishment has never shown to deter crime past a certain point. It's to make people in society feel better. 
I would agree with that statement. But what I am saying is not about prevention in that sense. 

What I'm saying is if murder carries a potentially lesser penalty (life) than raping a child (death), the law *creates incentive* for a rapist to murder the victim (and do enough damage to make a rape determination impossible). 

That's my issue with it.
While I agree in most cases, most rapists and pedophiles are repeat, serial offendors, this will at least protect future victims. 
Or you know, do the sensible thing and abolish the death penalty. They should instead focus on the prevention of crimes. 
If you rape a poor 12 year old, it might be humane to kill them afterward anyway.
Dude how can you even say that? 
Hopefully it would be enough deterrent to not do it in the first place, though.
It's been shown time and time again that a death sentence doesn't help as a deterrent. Anyone else who commits a crime of this nature is going to assume they won't be caught.

Sadly this decision is just going to put potential victims at an even greater risk for almost no gain.

It's an instinctive decision to want people who do these sorts of crimes to die, but if you want to *reduce* these crimes then, as a person, you need to think deeper.
They're far MORE likely to be convicted after a murder! A dead child from violent causes is an automatic case being opened by the police, plus nice leftover DNA evidence (I mean they were just raped), aka you're royally fucked.

A raped child in comparison, is just "making up stories" about his nice uncle for attention. Maybe he goes to the police years later down the line, but all DNA/hard evidence is long gone after that.
I think it's a big leap to go from child molester to murderer. Also, then the creepy uncle needs to explain why his brother's kid went missing after they went out for ice cream. Not sure it's as clear as you think. 
Even besides that, hasn't the American justice system already demonstrated that the death penalty is inherently flawed? At some point, you're going to end up executing an innocent person. 
Apart from being a deterrent or not, there is no better justice than death itself for these damned individuals. 
It doesn't sound like a good idea at all, and to be honest, if you've grown up in a 1st world nation, there is no excuse for you to think it does.

People who commit vile crimes are sick individuals; you can use the term "evil" if you like, but they have a sickness, and killing them is not going to get rid of the problem. Most child predators were/are victims themselves, and what's interesting to me is that if we find a child who's being victimized, the child gets treatment, psychological help, etc, and whatever devious behavior they've exhibited as a result of being abused is excused. However, if we DON'T catch the abuse, and a child grows up without being "rescued", there is a chance that this damaged child becomes a predator themselves. At this point, according to people like you, they are a monster who deserves to be put down.

Capital punishment is never just, because humans are rational beings, and people who do evil things are sick. The focus should be on improving society as a whole, putting more focus on mental health, creating bigger safety nets for people who are prone to deviant behavior, because it's our responsibility too, to ensure that people don't get to the point where they're able to act out on their sick thoughts. This also applies to school shooters and generally any heinous crime.
1) Death penalty doesn't sound like a good idea to begin with. 

2) If you get death penalty based on a <12yo child testimony, there is definately something wrong. 
Death penalty is never a good idea.
I'd argue this won't be the case. The ones who survived were lucky enough to not die. Or to put it another way, I don't think the rapist(s) decided to leave them alive. I think they didn't care either way what happened to the victim.
It will deter people from marrying 12 year old kids.
You're right, but this is the correct move when you think of the political implications. As an Indian i've seen all of my friends have been vocal about the Justice for Asifa movement, and accusations of religious favouritism are really bad for a Hindu nationalist party in a 'secular' country. A brutally tough stance on this will probably save their arses and satisfy the country's anger.
It's not about a deterrent. It's about giving the public a level of satisfaction following a conviction that won't result in the anti government protests that Indians are showing they are incredibly capable of organizing.

Another factor is that many of the people who go on to molest and rape children were themselves victims.

Of course, this is not condoning the horrific action, but it makes things more complex. It is like the child who is raped is given a death sentence themselves at the point of their rape.

I think there needs to be more of a prevention campaign, education to shift attitudes rather than just an attempted 'cure' by killing the perpetrators. More targeted programs to help rehabilitate child victims.

Better and more thorough across the board sentencing would be a start rather than going to the highest possible punishment.

fair point, make murder be slowly vivisected 
I always assumed this is why a lot of chomos kill their victims. Or at least, the ones that make headlines. The punishment for molesting/raping a minor is bad enough, so they end up killing in some deluded moment thinking they'll get away with it.

Fortunately, they rarely do in big, well publiicised cases.
Other problem being false accusations.
Thanks for fucking raining on my justice parade ughh
Child molesters tend to have repeated sexual victims. It's not a "one and done" sort of thing usually.
exactly, and the fact that kids lie all the time, and some can easily be made to lie. i'd rather we don't put people to death for anything, just in case we make a mistake. and we make a lot of mistakes. you can't undo death. 
Young kids lie. But not about rape.
you're joking right? i'm not home right now but there are countless cases of children lying about everything under the sun, yes including sexual assault, kidnapping, etc.. some for attention, some were coached by manipulative parents.

hell just recently in toronto an 11 year old lied about a man violently cutting off her hijab, it was national news, the prime minister of canada even tweeted about it. she lied, made the whole thing up, most likely because her parents forced her to wear it and she didn't want to.. so she lied about the assault so she wouldn't have to wear one anymore. 

kids lie dude
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMartin_preschool_trial

48 kids lied that they were abused several hundred times.

It was so common that there's a general page for it:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria

Millions of dollars wasted because people got kids to lie...
Like many have pointed out, there is still the rape charge if you murder the victim afterwards. So no, that won't save you; if anything, you've made the circumstances so aggravated that you're probably guaranteed death.
Disturbing! And true.
Honestly, those people don’t really respond to incentives. I don’t think that will make a large difference. 
Ok, how much would you give child rapist in order not to make them too scared of being punished. Twenty five years? Can you imagine spending 25 years in an Indian prison? What if some people will still decide than it's safer to kill the victim? 

What number should be chosen then? Fifteen years? Ten?
Fuck. That’s an insightful but morose fact. I apologize if you’ve addressed this further down the thread, but can you think of an alternative punishment that would more effectively deter the behavior? It’s sickening that these “humans” exist. 
add to that the amount of people who have been executed for a crime theyre innocent of and its clear its just populism/vengeance.
Seeing this theory a lot.  Would love to see a source backing up this claim.  
except they already have 101 reasons to kill the girl


How does it sound like a good idea? Anybody have faith in the Indian justice system never to sentence an innocent person? Or any justice system?
Or just convince the child they want it. It's not rape if they're willing.
They’ll just groom their victims longer. They don’t mind waiting. A predator can spend years grooming a victim. 
Smok'em while you got'em
Or you know, children forced to lie because of some vendetta and innocent people die.  I hope phys evodence is required.
That’s why the law should be small period of jail time, but pass a law that doesn’t penalize inmates for “punishing” convicted child rapists. 
Just like the politicians. Still doesn't stop this sentiment. "Oh please if _____ had been raping kids one of the kids would have said something by now!"
Ok, that's true but usually the rapist is someone the kid knew so I really don't think they will murder the child. If a kid dies or goes missing, they look at the family first. 
Louis CK did a bit about this. It was during his “let’s see how far I can push it” phase. 
I imagine being locked in a prison for life on child rape charges is a more brutal death sentence anyway. The moment fellow inmates catch a whiff of a child rapist, that prisoner is going to get fucking lynched in prison.

I don't know how secure or locked down Indian prisons are but I wouldn't be surprised if the guards turned a blind eye towards violence between fellow inmates.
Yeah burning the victim alive after molestation is pretty common in India. 
They kill them or burn the victims alive anyway. 
Still, that doesn't prevent rape from landing someone in prison for life in the US. Interesting thought though, if rape max sentence was reduced to something like 25 years. I'd think there would just be more of it and no significant reduction in rape/murders.
Whether deterrent or not, it's better to have death penalty so we can remove as many of these monsters from earth as possible. Why keep child molesters alive in the first place? 
If the molester has that line of thought to acoid death, why wouldnt he have the same thought to avoid jail time as well?
That won’t work. Even they did kill the child, it wouldn’t be long before someone discovered the cause of death and arrested the killer.
Just because someone is a pedophile doesn't mean they can murder a child Willy nilly. Those people who rape torture and murder children have a fetish with the torture and murder part and are even more deeply disturbed than pedophiles. 

Imagine someone said to you, "Hey, there's a good chance you're going to die unless you murder this child. In which case there's a slightly smaller chance you will die." Would you do it? I think even pedophiles would have an issue with that. Murdering someone isn't easy if you aren't a psychopath.
It sounds like your bettin' a fair child on this matter.
This is exactly why they had to change some of the sentencing laws in America, right? Too many dead kids?
I keep hearing this argument, and it makes sense in a lot of situations! But do you know of any studies I can research? I'm not sure that murder and rape are necessarily ok to a murderer or rapist. A murderer and rapist, for sure.

Then again, a person really struggling with sexual desires for children might find the death penalty a compassionate end to their torment.
I don't honestly think that they're going to be deterred because 'I can only get 25 years for this, and everyone will hate me, and this shit will completely ruin my life, but at least it isn't death'. 

Anyone who was going to kill a child after raping them is probably going to follow up on that plan regardless of the consequences. 
Since when killing gives you less chances to be convicted? Do you have any backing statistics, from any country? Following basic logic if you rape, there's a chance the person will be mentally disturbed to the point he or she won't even report a crime, following by straight up killing someone, where everyone from victim surroundings will be affected and mobilized, and it's much more severily punished. 
Murder is also punishable by death
Who thinks of that?!? Who hurt you?!?
I'm worried that this will lead to more lynchings. This is already a problem in India, where it is fairly common for lynch mobs to form if someone (particularly a child) is killed in a traffic accident, before a real understanding of the situation has been grasped. For this reason it is normal for drivers who have accidentally killed someone to drive or run away, sometimes (but not always) in order to get the police involved before a mob can form. This is probably more common in rural areas and less so (or not at all) in cities.

If people think that the law is on their side then they may be much quicker to form a lynch mob even without any real evidence that the accused is guilty. I know that sounds odd to us in the west, because of course it would be up to the courts to pass judgement, not the mob, but I have read of situations where just such a sentiment has carried sway.
Or until you realize it will absolutely result in the death of at least one person who wasn't guilty.
It doesn't sound like a good idea at all. All evidence points to this being a bad idea.
The odds of having a rapist AND a murderer in the same mind is slim. Still out there for sure though
Then clearly, the penalty for killing a child needs to be torture or death. 
The punishment for that should be "torture then death".
I really don't like this.... The justice system can only give "Beyond Reasonable Doubt" and they do get it wrong. This will result in innocent people dying.

And is this for men and women? Because I can imagine women molesters being let off easy
That and the death penalty is a bad idea in general.

Anyone who complains about "big government" or works from the attitude that governments always mess things up and/or are incompetent should oppose the death penalty.
Well what's the penalty for murdering children?
Not necessarily true. Some rapists might not be capable of murder. And life in prison is almost as harrowing a prospect a death. 

I'd say we should up the penalty for rape-murders to super death. But really they should be killed in more tortuous ways for crimes committed in commission of a rape.
> Sounds like a good idea... 

Seeing that death penalty is still a debate in some civilised country in the 21st century is mind boggling to me
I have no insight into the twisted mind of a criminal rapist, but I figure getting your jollies off and beating the life out of a child are probably not as equal as the punishment now is.  

I would say I would support this sentence in the west.  The victim doesn’t go through life wondering when their abuser is out of prison or what pervert will get them next.  He got got by the system and they can move on.  

And the pedo...while garbage, still a human being and doesn’t deserve the endless torture a psychologically mangled person such as them receives in prison


not really they could do the same to avoid life in prison solitary confinement 
[Why do kids disappear?](https://youtu.be/73Fy8zVp63w) implies the same thing.
The point is a retributist theory of justuce, and to ensure they cannot hurt anyone else.
Most predators count on the silence of the child as a precondition of harming them in the first place, and many want to use the same one multiple times.  A *missing* child would guarantee an investigation.  The death penalty can in some rare cases be a deterrent, but unless it's public, that's not the core point.  
This is so simple to see. Not sure why this is flying over so many peoples heads :/
It's nice until another false rape allegation 
Punishment is actually less
Damn. That's horrible and sad and completely plausible. 
Life in prison as a convicted child molester is already bad enough. It's not like any perpetrator ever considers getting caught, or he wouldn't do it in the first place.

The only worry I have is if this also applies to 13-year-olds.
Username checksout
Or the molester could just do us all a favor an kill himself
The world keeps saying India has a rape problem, now that they're doing something about it, you're not supporting it 
There are loads of reasons to not support it, he is voicing a pretty reasonable concern. It's like saying "the world wanted to stop ISIS, but now that we are gassing them you don't want us to stop them?"

Edit: it's not about whether something should be done, it's about what is being done.
That’s because you can’t do just any damn thing about it—you’ve got to do things that will actually have the results you seek. This may well backfire.  Tougher penalties often are satisfying to the public and look good for politicians who impose them, but they don’t necessarily have the intended effect. This isn’t a brand new issue—people have been talking about this in the US for years. And we’ve seen in the US that when draconian laws are passed, mandating extreme penalties for crimes of a wide range of severities, people will be more aggressive with their crimes. Like when the 3 strikes laws were passed. 

And it does exactly nothing for the prevention of rape if the victim is not a child.
Yeah because it's fucking retarded. I wouldn't support it if their "doing something about it" would be setting a dumpster full of hamsters on fire. Because it's stupid.

This makes things only worse by encouraging murder. Fuck supporting that. Use your brain.
That's right. Make it a murder problem
There's a difference between wanting *something* done and wanting *anything* done.  This is a bad idea.
Then perhaps the world should shut up. Outsiders making demands can make things worse.
Louis C.K.!!!! 
Yes!
Sadly, they rarely leave them alive.
Exactly my thoughts, sometimes I get to the point I think it's a good idea to get rid of humanity as a whole. There's just too many assholes around. 
Ding ding ding, we have a winner.
Also how many wrongful convictions happen and this is a sentence that cannot be lifted... except by Jesus
Fuck Indians. 
India has 50% the number of rape cases compared to the US with 4 times the population. This is absolutely not a defense for the cruelty act but maybe look at yourselves first.
I'm amazed you're the first to bring this up.

It makes me question how aware these other redditors are of the problem. How many even know that the event that started India on the warpath against rape was the gangrape/murder of a woman nicknamed Nirbhaya?

India has a serious rape problem and murder was often the solution for culprits even before this law.
Thing is this law came after 10 guys raped a 8 yo for weeks and they killed her after. Something similar happened recently in my country too, once again the victim was killed.
The only sensible comment here. Many rape victims are murdered anyway or die from their injuries, so it's not as if they're being spared at the moment. Many perpetrators of these crimes make sure their victims die or the violence they commit against them is so heinous that they die anyway. The country has a serious problem with sexual violence and violence against women in general. 
I saw some people suggesting taking a leaf from Germany's book. India's problems are way beyond what Germany is dealing with right now. 
Deterrents don't really work that well which is what people on here are saying and it's in fact true. The problem is not law or the lack of harsher punishment, it's the Indian sexist and misogynistic culture. This sick problem with the Indian society should be uprooted, especially at the rural level.
>What this order might do is remove some of these irredeemable creatures from our society

I do not understand the dogmatic insistence that everyone deserves and needs to be given a chance at rehabilitation. Some crimes are simply so heinous that the person doesn't deserve a second chance. Their moral values are so out of line with those of society that we are better off without them.

For what it's worth, I agree with the objection that the death penalty is unfair to the falsely convicted. But that doesn't change the fact that the people who are actually guilty don't deserve a second chance.
I think you are thinking at this from the lens of a predator attacking a random child, bringing them into their sketchy van and abusing them. But that is not how sexual abuse generally happens. It generally happens by people who are close to the victim, but for some reason feel sexually attracted to children without there being much they can do about it.
Sexual attraction is a very powerful push inside a brain, that can make people rationalize doing what their instincts tell them to do. For example, many pedophiles don't think they are harming the child, snd would probably never hurt one knowingly.

>I think you are thinking at this from the lens of a predator attacking a random child, bringing them into their sketchy van and abusing them. But that is not how sexual abuse generally happens.

But when it does happen the perpetrator is very likely to kill their victim. Look up the recent Asifa Bano case.

>It generally happens by people who are close to the victim, but for some reason feel sexually attracted to children without there being much they can do about it. 

I do agree with you, but still, if you are raping a small child there is something seriously wrong with you which means either we remove you from the society until that problem can be fixed in your head, or you are removed from the society indefinitely. I think that would be left to the bill makers and how the final law would be interpreted in the courts of law. But the argument that this will gives more reason for the rapist to murder their victim doesn't add up, I feel there are enough already, irrespective of the fact whether the perpetrator was a close family member or some random person.  
A "practical standpoint" just means your personal feelings on the matters which don't mean shit next to objective statistics and research.
No, that is actually exactly opposite because from what I have read there are a lot of murders already. I am actually not for capital punishment and I am agnostic on the topic.
What are you reading? Me and My Feelings? Because there's no peer reviewed study suggesting capital punishment is a useful deterrent.
Why are you so hung up on deterrent part of my comment. It is the last sentence and it is starting with a maybe. Bulk of my comment is about the nature of crime involving children, and what I have read about it given that I live in the country.

Deterrent might or might not happen, but the law (if the order does become a law) does not incentivize murder as there are already incentives regardless. That is what I was saying. Deterrent part was something I pondered, I don't know if it would. But that is not what I was commenting on.
I like how you spout all this bullshit but can't even give me a single credible source but your feelings. Adding another incentive for murder seems important.
Moreover you've still got a body with your DNA all over it, and disposing of such things can prove rather challenging and time-consuming.
Absolutely correct.
If you're fucked up enough to rape a 12 year old I don't think the law is going to deter you, and killing someone isn't taking them out of society more than locking them up, the only thing that will change is that some innocent people won't get a chance to be proven innocent 
I mean all it would take is 2 charges. Sure he gets life for that murder, that other charge for rape gets him the chair.
Except we don't see rape/murder as a common occurrence amongst pedophiles in countries with less harsh sentences. As long as murder adds serious weight to the punishment while rape is (comparably) lesser, while still severe, most rapists will think twice 
Your comment literally goes "yeah it makes sense they won't stop and instead will kill the kids to never be caught" but ends up with "it's a deterrent", contradicting yourself. It's amazing.
I said maybe a deterrent but the core of my comment is that there are other reasons for a rapist to consider murder not because there are laws punishing rape itself.
#A MURDER DOESN'T CANCEL OUT OTHER CRIMES FOR GOD'S SAKE
Okay, but what's your point? Did I say that murder does so? I don't think so. I am really confused by your comment, can you please include more for my better understanding?
Everyone is going "They're less likely to be sentenced to death when they commit murder, hence they're gonna murder the rape victim". Which makes absolutely zero logical sense.
>Everyone is going "They're less likely to be sentenced to death when they commit murder, hence they're gonna murder the rape victim". Which makes absolutely zero logical sense.

You would be wrong here. People are saying that it would incentivize the murder in order to destroy evidence, especially if the body is never recovered. My counter point is that a child rapist has already enough of an incentive after a heinous crime like that to commit murder so we might as well have laws that would sentence them to death.
>  and maybe act as a deterrent.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhahaahhaHAHAHAHAHAHA

Fool.
That doesn't really add much to the conversation does it? I am more than willing to admit my foolishness, but as you can see I did say "maybe" we can discuss  how it may or may not be a deterrent but I don't see how calling me a fool does achieve anything.
Exactly. I worked with an organization in West Africa that dealt with victims of child sexual abuse. The perpetrators were typically uncles or stepfathers.  In a low-income country the man in question may be a breadwinner for an entire extended family, in which case the victim is under a lot of pressure to keep quiet. Poverty reduction and better social security, as well as the things you mentioned, would do a lot more good than draconian punishments.
Spot on - the death penalty could serve as an effective deterrent towards reporting, not to mention that death penalty is irreversible - and innocent men will undoubtedly die due to wrongful conviction.
They made a new law as reaction to a 2013 rape case too.

How would they increase the conviction rates?(only solution I can think is lowering the bar of evidence)

This is a proper counter argument. It's not just the kids btw, most people who get raped are done so by someone they know. A lot of kids get molested and raped by relatives and family. 

Coming out as a rape victim in India is very very very hard. Putting forth your daughter as a rape victim of your brother/nephew/uncle/father/husband/etc is going to be very very very very hard thing to do in India because 1. You are more or less signing their death certificate 2. India is family/relative/society driven and outing one of their own will often have severe negative consequences for the girl and her family. For example, in a village it  may change her family's social status like who they can chit chat with or marry with...also it may lead to isolation of a family or worse they may be forced to go somewhere else. In cities it will be less worse but that doesn't mean there won't be consequences. Yes, society should be more supportive of rape victims, but...
Conviction rates just means how many of the cases brought to court led to convictions. Higher isn't necessarily better.

It might be that not enough cases are brought to court in the first place, and more people could be convicted justly without raising conviction rates.

But maybe there is a bias in law enforcement that protects some people's cases from being brought to court.
The amount of privileged citizens who have no idea of how the Indian government works is shocking! All the Redditors on this thread are acting like judicial experts and sociologists without realizing the political PR/goodwill stemming from the ordinance and also how it holds some placebo satisfaction for Indian citizens outraged at the recent rape issues. This 'better solution' will take time, not an instant change - until then, this acts a deterrence, effective or not :)
I'm not sure what it looks like in India, but I'd also advocate for mental health support. I was listening to a podcast the other day where there are some professionals, here in the states, who deal specifically people who have thoughts but never act on them, and swear never to. I don't know the efficacy of counseling for these individuals, but it must be unimaginably hard on people who have thoughts and feelings but know how morally wrong it is. 
It's a step up from blaming Chinese food at least.

https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-09-07/indias-politicians-blame-rape-chinese-food-cell-phones-jeans
Thought the same as women's rights seems to be gaining some traction there.  Also, that photo of the lawmakers without a woman in sight is kind of telling where they still are.
> According to data most of the child rape cases are committed by someone known to victim.

I bank on this. As the victim and rapist would know each other most probably, this ordinance of death penalty will work. 
Is your score hidden because you got downvoted to hell? Because thats stupid, you're completely correct. 
I'm from Delhi. 
A guy who graduated from my high schoool a few years ago killed an Uber driver when he was driving drunk on Xans, and he got away with it because he paid the cops off. Probably something small like $10k.
I take that to mean that legally it's all under 12s, but the writer is just relating it to on ongoing story of girls being raped.
thats a good point.... wtf

"YOUR HONOR THE DEFENDENT HAS PLEADED GUILTY TO THE RAPE OF THIS 6 YEAR OLD BOY!"

Judge "uh yeah normallly you would get death for that but because this is a boy ah just 20 years for you!"
As long as the law applies equally to both genders, and as long as girls under 12 are significantly more targeted, I'm OK with the phrasing here. I have no idea whether either of those are true, though.
This comment is the definition of whataboutism.

The reason girls are specifically being mentioned, is because the current controversy that is roiling India has to do with two girls, not to forget the Nirbhaya situation of a few years ago.
Maybe the rape of boys isn't a problem in India?
Baby steps. 
What about 13yos? 20yos? 95yos?

Indian man here.
It is sad that they are not commited enough for boys, but believe me although the physical torture may be equal but the societal torture is way more for girls than for boys.
Maybe it is kind of an pilot project, mostly because girls rape is astronomically high here. You won't believe how shitty girl-protection is here in India and how it has become a common advice for girls to be wary of their predators and try to be as non-attention drawing as possible.

My thoughts exactly!
Easy there, Sandusky.
That's the next step I guess, considering how huge the public uproar was to multiple rape cases against women that went into convincing people to consider this bill, it'll take decades before that passes and lawmakers can actually imagine that boys get raped and that would certainly require the huge number of female rape cases and gender inequality plaguing the country to go down. 

I think the way to look at this is that it's nice to aknowledge a step forward. 
Adding to this there another law that only defines punishment for cheating(in marriage) if you are a man ,u will be let go if u are a female.
They have what's called bus boys in India. Homeless boys who are publicly taken by bus drivers as appretences, prostituted, and raped by the driver for years.  It happens in public and isn't denied even on camera. I dont think their care about boys.
Nobody cares, in Indian law, males can't be raped, sexually harassed or be a victim of domestic violence 
Fun fact: According to Indian law, an adult woman having an extramarital affair is not responsible for her actions, rather the man she has had the liaison with is. He can be jailed.
We're still a backward country in so many aspects, especially this. 

me and my friend were talking about that last night. I wouldn’t call India “Backwards” or “Archaic” but I would say it’s solidly in mid development. So right now you have the older generation with wicked out dated ideals clashing with the younger generation who have taken to the new ideas of modern equality and justice. She showed me a documentary called the daughter of India and I was blown away by some of the things I heard coming from the rapist and his defense lawyer. I’m hopeful that there is a shift in how women are viewed over there though, the fact that my friend told me she can’t go out past 7 without her father is frightening 
I am feel uncomfortable when we are not about me?
Boys can't be raped, silly, everybody knows that /s
Tell that to my best friend after he raped me in high school
There aren't any gay people in India.  DUH.  Or women that rape young boys.  DUH.
[deleted]
It might be due to the legal definition of rape not including them one might think.
All that really matters is that you were able to find a way to use a story about child rape to play victim here. 
The exact thought I had
The ordinance has provision of 20 years in prison if age of victim is less than 16.
Tl;dr You will never support death penalty.
There aren't any juries in the Indian legal system and right now the judicial system is a mess. There is a power control fight going on at the top level. 

I agree with this order only in theory because I have seen judicial corruption first hand. Any person backed by a politician can get away by paying off judges. In the Asifas case too, the local lawyers and politician were backing the rapists.
Even so i still couldn't support it.  Aside from it being barbaric, my main reason is, how can we as a society say that you can't kill someone but since you did we are going to kill you?  The hypocrisy is insane.  If you don't condone the murder the person committed, how can you condone the murder of said person?  Then there is your excellent point.  There have been so many innocents executed... If you are going to do it at least make sure you arent killing an innocent person or the wrong person for fucks sake! Get it right! Or design a system that isnt hinged on human error or corruption, to deal with capital punishment  And if you do put an innocent man to death why not put the people who convicted said innocent man on death row as well for murder?  I could go on for fucking days. Its all so wrong.  
And if all relevant physical evidence is collected without contamination and interpreted correctly.
My friend that just moved here from India told me how someone in his town was drunk driving and he ran over and killed a bunch of people but he paid off the cops so he walked away with no charges. Also cops like to pull people over and ask for bribes otherwise they throw you in jail or write a ticket.
I still wouldn't. I'm not against death penalty because innocent may get killed, nor that I'm against death penalty because criminals need harsher sentences than death (that kind o thoughts is fucked up). I'm against death penalty because killing people is fucking disgusting.
And the government is clearly just trying to look like it's taking child rape seriously without actually doing anything about it. 
No to most of those in communal India. 
You've got the right idea. 
What about in the case where the evidence is overwhelming and it is obvious that the criminal cannot be rehabilitated? The death penalty could spare more lives than it takes away. 
Couldn't you give people life sentences and not risk anyone else dying? The death penalty in the US kills about 4% innocent people. Also as a side note I don't think the government should be given the authority to kill its citizens. It's a power that tends to get abused. 
sure, but does that rid of the issue where you can lock up the innocent for life? And is a life in prison so much better then no life at all? imo there are people that are unfit and cannot ever become fit to live in society, why should we force them to live in a cage?
A person with a life sentence can still appeal and go free. A dead person cannot. Also who do you trust to determine whether or not someone is unfit to live in society? The court systems are still incredibly biased against people of certain socioeconomic classes, so I don't trust the courts to always make the right call.

This isn't a matter of whether or not certain people deserve the death penalty for doing terrible things, it's a matter of whether or not you trust our convoluted bureaucratic government with the decision to take someone's life. 
Usually Reddit is vehemently against the death penalty on principle but when it's across the world suddenly things change.
No, it's not nice to see because they are *not at all* doing anything whatsoever to "tackle the problem". In fact, they are doing exactly the opposite. This is a completely meaningless move to be seen as "tough on crime" without having to do any of the things that might actually help, but which would need a budget.
Why what would you do... 
Perhaps castration and life in prison would be a better punishment
It won't tackle any problem. It's just fascists being fascists. 
so just add a rider that killing a child 12 or under is also punishable by death
I don't believe someone who would kill a child to avoid the death penalty is going to flinch at the idea of killing them to avoid life in prison.
May be, it is difficult to predict the behaviour of a demented mind. However, I think most of them would prefer to not kill the victim. Killing a human being is not an easy task, however, fear of death can make any people dangerous.
Imagine being so horny that you'd rape a child *and* kill & mutilate them just to bust one nut.
[deleted]
I wish you could see that all the countries you like to call "shitholes" are filled with uneducated people who are prone propose and do things without considering the consequences first. Not much unlike yourself. 
There are a lot of bad things to say about America, they even got the whole bring-your-own-device going
Absolutely agree. Murder is murder no matter who is doing it, whether it's a court, a government or an individual. It's really disappointing to see how many people advocate this brutal and archaic form of punishment. 

Besides, why do we want to give governments the authority to kill people? These people are largely fallable. They make mistakes all the time, or just generally have questionable morals. I don't even trust the government with mundane things sometimes like properly allocating funding, but I'm supposed to trust them to justly kill only the right people? No way. 
I don't understand why "killing innocents" is the main point here. Killing someone is disgusting period. It's not about not killing innocents or making criminals suffer longer or whatever. Death penalty is disgusting in itself. It's no wonder the western world abolished it during the 1970s
Exactly. People who rape minors deserve a lifelong prison sentence and a treatment of their pedophilic feelings, but not the death penalty.
I think we can agree that there are no grey areas when the rape victim is under the age of 12, assuming the accused is an adult or tried as an adult. 
What's your point?
They just need to be educated. And it starts with empowering the women of their country. I’d say (from my own observation) one of the reasons why the rape rates are so high is because women are not allowed to be good at anything, 
They aren’t educated or even shown how to work, live or anything, just taught to be a housewife. This leaves them vulnerable to equally uneducated men who don’t understand the full wretchedness of their crimes.

Education. Such a simple solution, yet no ones done anything to tackle the problem with it.
A LOT of women are educated in my country. We have also been fighting against sexual abuse for long. When Nirbhaya happened, we fought for better laws and control. Most men in this country, however, are extremely entitled and think that's women are objects to be treated in any manner. So even if a woman is educated, she has no power.
One of the few things I know absolutely is, education of women and raising their status in each traditional society, is about the most important thing we can be doing. What country are you from, friend?
I have a friend from Sweden who married a girl from India, and they lived together for five or six years, it was in the state that’s near Pakistan. He basically said, every man is so sexually frustrated because of the crushing society around them that they spend all of their time trying to download porn in Internet cafés, because it’s the only place they can view such material.
That maybe the case few years ago but now even really low earning people have mobile with internet(thanks to cheap chinese mobiles and cheap 4g net).Though I agree porn is considerd taboo here for some reason(my parents didnt let me get internet for long time because I might see "bad pictures" of women on the net).
Deterrence is rarely the reason behind punitive judgement but societal retribution. After all, there's no real deterrent to locking someone up for most crimes.
The death penalty has never been a deterrent for anything. It's revenge. 
Also if someone's family member committed the rape, then this just makes the victim even less likely to come forward and more likely to be silenced by their family. 
All you have to do is find one case where a rapist served time in jail, then got out and raped again.  If the rapist was killed instead of incarcerated, some victims would have been spared.
Counterpoint: All you have to do is find one case where a person was convicted and executed, only to later be proven innocent, to decide the death penalty is fucking barbaric.
It's weird.  Here on this website we get stories *every single day* of law enforcement fucking up, but once you start talking about certain kinds of crimes everyone starts assuming that the justice system is 100% accurate.
That point can be used to argue against the entire current justice system 
Very true. But at least those exonerated following years of incarceration can be compensated and aren't, y'know, dead.
"All you have to do is find one case where a _______ served time in jail, got out, and then (reoffended) again."

You can fill in that blank with anything. Should all offenses be life offenses on this basis? Where do you think we should draw that line?

Incidentally, my argument is against capital punishment. Life in prison accomplishes the same as capital punishment in this regard. 
Where we draw the line is a different discussion that I’m not interested in.  You asked someone to disprove your opinion that capital punishment doesn’t reduce crime.  I think it’s easy to see that capital punishment does reduce crime because the criminal cannot repeat the crime after being executed.


Also, life sentences will not accomplish the same result.  Inmates can escape prison, and inmates can commit crimes in prison.  Nobody comes back from the dead.
Jesus: hold my beer

FTFY
China, Saudi arabia, use have capital punishment and each have low rape rates.
One thing India has got going for it is a very robust appeal system. So robust that with enough money can happily live your life and die before the matter is finally decided in the highest courts.
Here's how I see it.  A country with really bad records of prosecuting rapists just increased the punishment for prosecuting rapists.
The laws against rape are already harsh in India (these laws now apply to children over the age of 13).

But yeah, I agree with your overall point. Law enforcement and securing rape convictions are horrifically low in India, and that's the real problem here.

Instead of this, they should make it so that any law enforcement personnel who refuse to file rape complaints or who deliberately botch an investigation, any judge who clearly fails in their duty to uphold the law, will be treated as if they are party to the crime itself.
> Wait, so children over 12 years of age do not feel the same way about being raped? Isn't a 13 year old still a minor? And does a child at 13 suddenly become immune to rape? 

Are you really this obtuse? Try to understand that they have to put a delineating line somewhere, so why not twelve.
12 seems fairly arbitrary...or not, perhaps this is a way of enforcing the culture of child brides, so husbands of girls age 13 can't be sentenced to death
It has to end somewhere, you can draw that line out to " what 21 year olds getting raped isn't so bad then?"
Using this logic, why is raping someone at 18 more ok than raping someone at 17? Does a person at 18 suddenly become immune to rape?

We live in a society that believes that raping children is more severe than raping an adult. With that, there has to be an official, legal point where "children" become "adults." You can make that number 12, 18, 21, or 47, but it has to happen eventually, or you destroy the extra punishment for raping children.
Holy shit you are scraping the bottom of the barrel for things to complain about
Yet here you are...
So are you for or against the death penalty for kiddie fuckers?
Against the death penalty.
Understandable. As much as my feelings tell me that people who hurt children in that way sould all die. We can't give into our want of  revenge. We must be better than the monsters. Life in jail. That's what I want for them. To never see beyond four walls agian. 
How is life in jail not revenge?
you know what else is a shithole?
u
Are wrongly convicted to spend the rest of their lives in prison?
Better than having them killed, don't you think?
18 is the legal age of consent irrespective of religion under Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013. So yes, it is automatically rape. We have to wait for the Cabinet and Supreme Court to release their notes to understand the 12 threshold. I think they will introduce a no anticipatory bail clause for rapes on under 16 yr olds as well. Lets see.
It’s necessary in severe cases. 
No it isn't, it's only necessary in some people's revenge fantasies.
It’s not revenge. It’s retribution. Some things are so heinous it’s warranted. 
Dress it up however you want, it is the same thing.
Unless you think no one should ever be punished I highly doubt you think that. Or you just don’t know what retribution is. 
You're in the wrong place if you want justice.  Reddit loves a good revenge story.
Why is retribution for child rapists not justice?

I would want to see them killed because thats the value system I believe in - no leniency towards child rapists. I don't want to live in a society that keeps child rapists alive.

Same reason why I don't want to see life sentences or death for nonviolent offenders or crimes of passion.
So you support the implementation of the death sentence, even though it has been constantly shown to be impractical, due to people being wrongly convicted and unjustly being on death row?
Man that's a loaded question. And, for what it's worth, [I do agree that the death penalty is unfair in practice.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8duloh/death_for_rape_of_children_below_12_says_indian/dxqakdt/) 

I do support the death penalty in concept. The problem isn't with execution itself, but rather that society isn't good enough at determining who is guilty and who isn't. That's a problem that needs to be solved no matter what your stance on the death penalty is (wrongfully putting people in prison isn't great either).

When that day comes, I will wholeheartedly support the death penalty.
Where are you seeing massive support for this? Because it certainly isn't here. Most people seem to be against this and Reddit's Pedo Defence Force is due to show up soon. People saying this is a good decision and pedophiles deserve this are being downvoted. 
What kind of punishment would you rather want for child rapists?

What is justice in this case?

Not rhetorical questions. I want to hear your opinion.
People prey on others for the hope and promise of power. Criminals are easy targets, and when they are punished it strengthens the community as a whole.
How about "No death penalty for anything, Says Indian Government, Clears Executive Order". That would be *actually* be better.
That's the first thing you think about? I'm assuming in order to be convicted there has to be DNA evidence. An accusation won't go very far without DNA.
People have been falsely convicted of rape and a whole host of other crimes before; what makes you think that'll change?
It’s a salient issue to raise. The problem with capital punishment is that, in the case of a miscarriage of justice, the accused cannot be resurrected. Even with DNA evidence—which, as we have learnt, is not as reliable as we had once been told—we cannot be sure that a person has committed the crime of which he has been accused.
More people would be in favour of the death penalty if the justice system was infallible, but it isn't, and the death penalty is way to permanent to allow any kind of mistakes.

they've already got a bunch of reasons to kill the little girl and there's no meaningful study that has been done about the death penalty as a deterrent for *pedophiles*. people are vapidly adding the hypothesis on top of studies that don't account for this variable
Fair point. But you really have to ask yourself how you can solve this problem. I am really confused here, why does India have a rape culture but other western democracies without capital punishment don't seem to have one. 
You don't know what you're talking about. It's just pure ideology speaking through you.
No it makes sense, think about it. The rapist now knows if the victim talks then that's a death sentence for them, so the rapist is probably going to do the one thing that would silence the victim permanently. 

This law might lower the amount of rapes, but it's going to increase the amount of children killed after the rape.
[removed]
Riiiight. Rape and murder might be a good thing.

You know what's good population control? Reducing the number of births. You know what's bad population control? Murdering children.
Lol
It’s not considered a rape then
How about jail for people who commit crimes, instead of bloodthirsty revenge.
Should be all ages period. 
It makes sense
No, it doesn't. There is exactly one crime and one crime only that deserves even the possibility of a death sentence, and that is first-degree murder. Period.
Then what might you suggest they do with them?
Likely, they should convict them if guilty, and sentence them to a long, long term in prison. Which I imagine is what already happens. Just as they do in the States.
and here in the states we the tax payers have to pay for these disgusting people’s stays for 20 or so years at a prison. That ain’t cheap you know 
And... so what? Nothing is cheap. That logic suggests we should also disband police and firefighters, because those services ain't cheap either.

It's what needs to happen. No one wants a world with a shit ton of prisons or prisoners. In reference to capital punishment, giving someone a death sentence (even on the rare occasions it is actually merited) is actually *more* expensive for the system than just giving them a long prison term. Did you not know that? Look it up.

That’s 1,646,000$ per year compared to a lethal injection around the prices of 1300$ give or take some. It literally costs more in legal fees for this stuff than the execution itself. Either way that’s certainly more if you actually do some research. Now let me ask. Did you look anything up?  

Minimum has been changed to 20 years for child rape below 12. The old minimum was 10.

The one you are talking about is for adult-rape, and that has now been changed to 10 according to new rule.

Yes, the death penalty is for cruel cases.
Bad Idea. An 18 year old guy having sex with his 17 year old girlfriend with her consent is also rape, as legally the 17 year old can't give consent. The family of the girl can file a case, and the boy will be hanged to death according to what you said.

Not everything is so black and white.
But lot of rapes in India go unreported or even if they do get reported, the law enforcers shrugg it off. 
Does China have a rape problem?

> Besides, instead of looking and questioning the core problem of this kind of action by interrogating the offender, not much going to archieve by just killing them.

Why would you need to? The death penalty is a safe and permanent cure.
Cure to what? Others wont get cured by kiling a psychopath, other psychos wont be like oh wow dude im now not mental.
Hey don't be an asshole. By 12 years old the average Indian child weighs *at least* 14 pounds.

What's dis
> it will result in an additional (death) sentence

You are sentenced to death twice. We will kill you, find the being into which you are resurrected, and then kill you again.
Murder + dispose of corpse via burning = no evidence of rape.
You are largely correct.
Kill them twice 
How does one forensically prove molestation(non-rape)?
Then you have to ask yourself what is the penalty for raping a corpse?

You'd get fucked up situations where people would choose whether to kill or to sex first and that's fucked up.
You just play one on TV? :) 
And if they are motivated to kill them to destroy the body and thus any evidence...?

The rape in Kathua was one of the most horrific things I have ever come across. But this was already part of the reason until begins *killing* her, and of the two evil acts, the murder was even worse. We would all prefer Asifa Bano to be alive. 
Death penalty in India is usually reserved for the rarest of rare cases. Gruesome acts basically. 

You’re right that they can determine molestation/rape through forensics but there’ll just be one death sentence! (I’m a lawyer)
Um..where did you get that info? India certainly has NO plans of abolishing the death penalty as of now. And if you know anything about this govt (they're right wing), they would only move towards making punishments even stricter. But you're right about actual executions taking place - they're quite low. It's India's bane that our law system is so archaic - it's pretty much the same as the British handed over to us - it needs revamping because the Indian society and population is very different. We even have different marriage laws depending on the religion. Murder under Indian Penal Code (IPC) section 302 is definitely chargeable with the death penalty but like you said it's reserved for the rarest of murder crimes. But gruesome rape resulting in murder almost always gets awarded the death penalty. Even if they didn't, Indian prisons are shitty places making the perpetrators wish they were given the death penalty anyway. 

Regarding the appeal to the President, the trend is being reversed nowadays and at least three mercy petitions have been overturned in the recent past. 
> If the molester murders the victim, it can still be forensically proven that it was a case of molestation/rape.

Well sure, though it would be much easier to cover up the rape if the only incentive is to avoid a rape instead of a murder charge. 
but wouldn't the rapist still have a high incentive to murder?by silencing  the victime, the chance of being discovered shrinks.
Do they usually check for molestation/rape when examining the body? I’m just not familiar with the process but I feel if that isn’t a usual thing then they’d just assume it’s a murder case and thus a less harsh sentence
I'm not a supporter of the death penalty but if it ends an endemic culture of child rape it might be necessary. At least in the short term where large scale rehabilitation is not a feasible possibility. 
"awarded death sentence"
Unless you meat grinder and burn the body after the murder.
Do you have a link?  That sounds super interesting.  Never thought about it like that.
Uh...think of it this way, he knows the chances of the kid telling someone that they got raped is higher if they let the kid go after, than to just rape then kill the kid, bury the body, and hope no one finds it.

Not supporting the rapists, giving a possibility of line of reasoning.
Yeah, I agree that it would. But that's assuming it's possible to determine rape occurred. I hate that my mind even went there, tbh. Sorry that I'm taking you there, too. But I have to assume someone capable of these kinds of acts would be capable of anything. They would do whatever they could to destroy evidence. It's an extreme and thoroughly horrifying thought, no question. It still leaves room for the loophole.

IMO, the only way to ensure no loophole exists is to raise the penalty for murdering a child to the same as raping a child.
That's why you burn the body
You're right, but I'm sure there are those who would roll the dice in order to avoid being caught for the rape itself. Murdering the victim would eliminate the witness.
You can obfuscate the rape by mutilating the body in certain ways such as burning.
i think his point is, that you are less likely to get caught if the victim is dead 
But the witness disappears 
Ya but if the veganaman gonna die after he rapes babby might as well kill babby to make it more worth it right
Is child rape and murder really something to joke about?
Does it make the point any less valid?
> rape of girl 

Okay, I know reddit always has to bullhorn this point when it comes up.

But goddamn India, you don't need to add gender to rape laws. It's going to bite you in the ass sooner or later.
>  or death in case of rape of girl of 12 years or younger.

Sorry, I should have been more clear. This is the part I was speaking about.

> No, the death penalty is only given in "rarest of the rare" cases.

That's what concerns me. If someone were to rape a 12 year old child (Jesus, typing that is not easy), I'm afraid the attacker might decide to murder the victim in order to possibly circumvent the death penalty if caught.

My hope is Indian courts would sentence someone to death for that, but the law doesn't explicitly say so. As such, I think India should also pass a law guaranteeing death for anyone who murders a child. Otherwise, there is a potential loophole.
Separate charges, separate judgment. If death is awarded in one the other is moot.
I think what people are getting at here isn't that the rapist would try to "replace" a rape charge with a murder charge, but rather that they might murder the victim and mutilate the corpse in a way that destroys all evidence of rape. 

It's disturbing to even think about but that doesn't change the fact that it is a loophole the the most monsterous of people could take advantage of.
No witnesses.
so if i jerk off and some of the... material... lands on a bear-skin rug, did i commit bestiality? 
It's great at preventing repetitive offenses though.
That's not what the study says. 

It just says that the American judicial system does not effectively tier punishment to deter crime.
The Department of justice *summary of the evidence* (which summarizes evidence from multiple studies), says:

> 1. The certainty of being caught is a vastly more powerful deterrent than the punishment.
>The certainty of being caught is a vastly more powerful deterrent than the punishment.

Big Brother is watching you
Sure? That seems pretty obvious, but it also is a non-sequitur to say that the punishment itself is irrelevant as a deterrent factor.
I'm not saying it's irrelevant. But why focus on the thing that can have the smallest effect?

I think it comes from a primitive thirst for vengeance and sometimes virtue signaling (people not wanting to be seen as "soft on crime" and wanting to show how violently they hate criminals), rather than what could actually help reduce cases.
The thing is that increasing the probability of catching criminals is hard and expensive. Increasing the deterrent factor *can be* very cheap. Singapore for instance canes for a bunch of crimes, which costs basically nothing.
>There is no proof that the death penalty deters criminals.

This study is meaningless in this context, a whole new study would have to be done focused on pedophiles

You're adding a whole new hypothesis on top of this study
What study? There are dozens of studies, that is a summary from the Justice Department.

Are you saying that the default should be to have death penalty until we can figure out whether it works or not?
At A certain point there is no chance ofrehabilitation, which should be the point o. Prison. Might as well kill them to prevent them doijg further harm.

In my mind raping a child puts you well beyond the realms of rehabilitation.f
Luckily, "in your mind" is not how evidence-based policies are developed.

Many sexual abusers can be rehabilitated.
"Might as well kill them" is not an argument.

If rehabilitation is not possible life in prison is effective enough, cheaper and allows to reverse unjust/erroneous judgments. Plus without the moral dilemma of having the state lawfully murder people who are already under its control. 
On the other hand maybe it's easier to get away with a rape than a murder?  If the criminal thinks the victim won't talk or identify them then that's easier than having to hide a body which may attract people's attention.
I wish. 20 years of writing software just does this to you. 
Well, the news I have seen about rapes in India almost always end up with a dead victim, so she may be right. 
Deterrents apparently don't work all that well.

Edit: the markings of a civilized society is how the people at the bottom are treated - everyone from criminals to the homeless. That includes the most despicable people you could ever think of. A great example is how Norway - both the state and the people - handled and discussed Breivik.

Now, the comments on my original comment make me distressed. So many of the comments talk about fantasies of violence and death. The emotional response is usually the one that causes more damage than you're trying to prevent.
Deterrents are for crimes of opportunity- crimes anyone would do if they could get away with it, like minor theft.  People who would rape a kid aren't really thinking about consequences.
India already have deterrence before this, rape is already a crime, it just doesn't work. Its the enforcement part that is the problem, not what punishment they give out. 
As someone who deals with these kinds of people on a continual basis, and was abused as a child myself **let me help out with some insights** CAUTION: Some heavy stuff here.

Generally, actual child abuse committed by a pedophile, much like murder committed by a psychopath, is a matter of lack of outlet, or alternatively, due to incredible shame (which in turn makes outlets less effective). As we study the condition further, history shows that these people having pretty disgusting upbringings themselves, or are brought up in an extremely devoutly religious space. There are exceptions to this rule, but frequently it's found that those exceptions are based on ABI's (acquired brain injuries), or heavy drug use.

There is another exception to this which I won't truly discuss, and that's the kind of child abuse committed by rich psychopaths, who are generally not pedophiles in and of themselves (that's a whole other ball game entirely). These people won't find this a deterrent because of their belief (mostly justified) that they are above the law.

**At no point is someone** who gets to the point where the shame gets so much, or the lack of outlet impacts their life to a major degree, **going to truly consider this a deterrent**. At that point, the thought of acting on their mental slant is so strong, that it pervades every waking moment of their day. While I don't expect sympathy for this (and don't have any myself), it can quite literally be torture.

You have to comprehend that a person like this is **beyond rational thought**. They are unable to see the world as it's intended. They may even get to the point where they experience delusions on such a scale that they'll believe the child wants the experience, or is flirting with them. Anything that their brain can come up with to give the person an outlet, it will do... that's how brains work.

I'm willing to discuss this in more detail, but I ask that anyone asking questions be very open minded and understand that the answers may not be particularly pleasant to read.

If you've read this far and aren't completely affronted by what you've read, I ask that you try to consider a difference between a pedophile, and a child abuser. The two are not even close to the same thing. A pedophile, like a psychopath, or many other mental traits, doesn't choose that life, or those thoughts.

We have the death penalty in my state, it doesn't slow down the murder rate at all. 
sex is one of the primary force that drive human actions, and is extremely hard to deter. This is why you learn that a lot of serial killers are serial killers because they derive sexual pleasure form whatever they are doing. 
Anytime you start a rebuttle with "hopefully", chances are the orginal theory will rein supreme... 
People that rape children are very very very sick people.  They simply will never reason “I really want to rape that kid.  But our criminal justice system is very severe toward this kind of conduct.  Best I not do anything at all.”  Even in most other crimes, punishment (or the death penalty) is generally not an effective deterrent against crime, particularly heinous ones.

https://nij.gov/five-things/pages/deterrence.aspx
You think the thought process for someone willing to rape a child includes consideration of consequences?

No.

No one committing a crime ever thinks they’ll truly get caught. 
What of those who are wrongfully accused?

We have exonerated many people who were given the death penalty in the United States post humously. 
Problem is we don't know.

We don't have enough scientific research to begin making policy based on anything other than what makes us feel good.
Death Penalty as a deterrent DOES NOT WORK.
If the punishment is prison for killing the kid, and death for raping them, all you'll get is a lot of dead children.
For real? Sick!
They never really work.
> When experts tasked to overhaul rape laws had looked into this demand following the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in the national capital, they had noted that capital punishment for rape "may not have a deterrent effect".

probably not, the law was kinda of a heat of moment thing, just to cave in to rpessure from the population.

> The centre today signed off on an ordinance, or emergency executive order, to introduce capital punishment for child rapists, a move that is seen as an effort to signal the government's commitment to fight sexual crimes against young girls. The change was cleared at a meeting of the Union Cabinet convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi **within hours of his return from a five-day foreign tour.**

The death penalty has never been shown to be a deterrent.
We have learned time and time again that this will result in these sick individuals killing more children instead of preventing it completely. 
Severity of the deterrent isn't as important as the belief of the offender that he'll be caught.

Better increase investigation resources than increase the sentence.
Criminals don’t follow laws 
If the whole getting raped in prison for decades isn't working, not sure how much this will change.
Yes, because the death penalty has worked so well in the past, everywhere throughout history for every crime for which it has been employed.
You don't deter people from crimes like this. Its not rationally thought out.
How well has the death penalty worked as a deterrent for murder in the United States?
Doubtful. Experts believe that the death penalty isn't much of a deterrent, compared to existing penalties. 
  
Imagine that you're going to go to prison for, say, embezzlement. What is it you're instantly afraid of?  
  
Now imagine that you're going to go to prison for molesting children. What are you afraid is going to happen to you now?
  
Does the death penalty seem all that much worse?
Someone’s obviously never seen Strangelove 

/s
The severity of the penalty doesn't deter, what deters is a sure and quickly applied penalty. We established that hundreds of years ago. Together with the same thing the guy up here said, if two crimes have the same penalty, there's no reason to not commit the greater one.
lol
Hope isn't a very strong argument
Except we have research showing the death penalty is not a deterrent 
Just like the drug war
Yeah, someone who is willing to fuck kids will probably be perfectly reasonable about consequences 
Just like the death penalty keeps people from killing right?
I'm thinking the kinda people who rape children don't think much about the consequences of raping children.
The severity of punishment generally isn't a deterrent. But the certainty of being caught is. 

For example - any idea what the punishments for driving over the blood alcohol limit is? first offence?  third offence?  maybe a basic idea but not really.  But what people do say is - i don't want to stop and get checked. 
The point is that there is now NO downside to killing the child, and major upside.

EDIT: Would anyone care to comment why they downvoted this post. It is concise and informative. 
/r/nocontext 
It's been proven a million times, laws don't deter people. 
But sexy kids
dude the penalty for smuggling dope in some countries is death and people still roll the dice.. you think some psychopath gives a shit about potential punishments? they either don't give a shit, or are convinced they'll never get caught.
I don't think pedosexuality works like that
In your opinion what would reduce these vile crimes?
Tell that to singapore, where mere drug possesion is a death sentence. They aren't known much for their drug problems...
Other developed Asian economies like Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan don't have much of a drug problem either, even though they don't have the death sentence for drug trafficking. The Singapore example may be more correlation than causation. 
>it's been shown time and time again that a death sentence doesn't help as a deterrent

sure, when it comes to homicide or worse in a death penalty state. the demographic of people that the have been shown not to be frightened by the death penalty is fundamentally different here

Would a life sentence help?  Or 30 year? 20 year? 10 year?  Would any prison at all help?

It is true that most criminals don't expect to get caught but it can act as a deterrent for even slightly rational person as the consequences are now much severe 
Well we only know a death sentence doesn't work as a deterrent based on study's done in America where a death sentence is for murder, a crime already viewed as the one of the greatest evils by our society. India is a far different animal. Society over there, especially outside of the larger cities in more rural villages, still practices things like child marriage. Furthermore India is right next to the Middle East which we know has had its own issues with things like child marriage. By making it punishable by death it forces a change in how it's viewed by their society even in the most rural areas. While it might not keep child rapists from raping it will imprint on everyone else that child rape is the worst of the worst in terms of crimes and will force people to not look the other way. 


Like if you saw someone steal a car you might not stick around to give a police report if you were really busy because the punishment of GTA is not that high in comparison to murder and if the police were to find out you witnessed it your culpability would be substantially less than if you had observed a murder and just walked away and didn't give a police report. That's what they are doing with child rape here. Part of the reason they are increasing the penalty so that if you are aware of it or complicate in not doing anything to report it or prevent it there is a bigger penalty awaiting you. It's about shaping a societal opinion on the matter not just creating deterrence.
But the upside is you remove those people from society, permanently, so they will never commit those atrocities again. It is better to kill rapist than let him kill innocents.

You may say its also possible to lock them for life. But if a major government reform happens when they are locked "for life" it may be changed to "max 25 years" for example. And then, when 25 years is done, society has a problem. [Here's example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariusz_Trynkiewicz) of amnesty changing death penalty to 25 years, and then government having huge problems keeping him locked. IIRC they invented new law just for those cases. 
>Anyone else who commits a crime of this nature is going to assume they won't be caught.

This part is actually slightly incorrect - [see my response here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8duloh/death_for_rape_of_children_below_12_says_indian/dxq9osc/?context=1)

That being said, I love your views, and they are very much the correct viewpoint as far as I'm concerned.
Your response sucks dick

Sorry I’m being a dick :(
You should realise that if I were a less adapted individual, what you wrote could have caused someone like me to enter a depressive spiral of self hatred, cutting, and more. 

Some of your other comments you've made on posts are really the same, you should really go back and read your own comments you've written just in the last day. Picture what someone with mental distress might do.

Don't be a dick.

EDIT: Dear downvoters, you're missing some serious context here - but I don't want this user brigaded so I've left it out. It was pretty bad shit
I’m sorry but I myself have some unresolved issues with trauma if that isn’t obvious. I shouldn’t have even come onto this thread to be honest. Some comments make me really irrationally angry. I deleted the comments bc I was being an asshole. I don’t want to be like that. I’m trying not to be one.
I think we both have unresolved issues with trauma, so we're doing a whole hedgehogs dilemma thing. Just lashing out against each other. 

Trauma fucking sucks like that. I'm sorry I was a dick right back.
Yeah you’re definitely right. We should help eachother instead. <3 thanks for being nice and understanding I was acting like a fucking idiot (read the message I sent)

>  A dead child from violent causes is an automatic case being opened by the police, plus nice leftover DNA evidence (I mean they were just raped), aka you're royally fucked.

If the body is found in the first place you're already royally fucked.
The childs still dead...

I dont think the assumed ease of conviction for the murdered childs perp being a benefit in that regard.
But...the possible sentence for murder in India is lighter than the one the article is talking about.
If the body is found. The body of a young child is quite a bit easier to handle than an adult. Drop the body in a river or lake and all usable DNA evidence will be destroyed in a day or two. 
>  leftover DNA evidence

This is India we're talking about dude
What does that mean?
India is not exactly known for their forensic departments.
India isn't as developed as most Western countries, but that doesn't mean their technology hasnt advanced since the 20th century... what an utterly ignorant comment.
I never said they didn't have the technology, but a country where 1.3 billion people still live under the caste system and widespread poverty and overpopulation is a way of life hardly bodes well for the implementation of competent DNA analysis being a resource local police rely on.
[deleted]
> But there’s also a strong and highly educated middle and upper middle class in India.

Of course, but statistically poverty stricken areas with tribal police are where most of the murder rapes happen. In the US a murder is about a 1/3 chance of being unsolved and DNA analysis isn't as common as you would like to believe and that's with a country with much more of a middle and upper class.
Not just that, but throw the body in the ganges, probably even two hours in there would provide so much additional DNA evidence it would be practically impossible to determine anything.
Yep..indians haven't figured out DNA sequencing. It's just some advanced high tech shit taught in high schools
That's a good point.  We should encourage rapists to murder more children so that it becomes easier to convict them.  Justice prevails!
Oh, you must live in the USA to consider this stuff.
I think it should be reserved for cases with rock solid evidence, like long duration 4k HD resolution video and fingerprints, and where the criminals are incurably dangerous to society, e.g. serial rapists and murderers.
The chances of a rapist being falsely accused in India are very low; in a huge amount of cases the victims families don't want the word to get out. 
Now add that to the fact that its a kid under 12. How many kids under 12 do you think would make something like this up? Besides, rape can be proven more easily than murder because of incontrovertible DNA evidence (assuming the body still exists).
It is my understanding that in certain interview situations, children are likely to invent stories of sexual abuse if they believe that will please the interviewer:

Can't believe I forgot about this, I learned about it in a seminar freshman year. You're right.
> because humans are rational beings, and people who do evil things are sick

I wish i could be that optimistic, but I'm not. Some people calmly and rationally enjoy causing others pain. And why not? What in all the natural law of the universe says they shouldn't? Only man and his tomfool idea that there's something called morality and justice.

>  "How does one man assert his power over another, Winston?"

> "Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation.

That’s nice and all, and maybe it works in some countries, but in places like India there are too many problems to worry about the well-being of individuals who only harm society. And we can work on improving society while also getting rid of irreformable people. People like serial killers and rapists with more than 1 victim, they are just never going to be reformed, they are just a problem to us.
I don't believe rapists have an illness that can be cured, sometimes people are bad just because they want to be, sometimes there's no reason for it.
Shocked that people think bringing back capital punishment is a good thing in any sense of the word. You can't have a civilised society with such sentences.
That's just you're opinion
I mean if you kill the person the problem is gone. I frankly don't care why people rape and kill and if India gets rid of the problem this way good. 

> I frankly don't care why people rape and kill

Well, that's fine, but then you're admitting to being a simple-minded person, which..good for you, I guess.

>if India gets rid of the problem this way good.

We all know this is not going to get rid of any problem.
Figuring out why people do it is the very first step towards figuring out a solution. A solution that prevents it before the act takes place and not after would be most ideal 
> they have a sickness, and killing them is not going to get rid of the problem.

Yes it will. No more sick individual doing bad things, individual no longer suffering from sickness, society safer, everyone better off.
There are medical ways of proving rape by testing the victim and suspect and a witness testimony is not enough to convict as it wouldn't pass the threshold of proof. 
Well, often times the 12 year old is dead, and doesn't have the benefit to testify, AND the people who committed the crime get away with it more times than not.
Oh it is. But for some crimes that call for death penalty, it might be too light punishment
Curious why is it a good idea sometimes? People keep spouting on about it's cheaper for them to be sentenced to life in prison, but that's also due to the laws in place and is most definitely different depending on the country. So looking at determent as the main reason we already know that doesn't work. Many people listed why in the comment thread. I really have no idea why death penalty would be good at all. And there are even down sides of course besides money for the US.

Killing innocent people does happen in the US and other countries maybe even more often. Not to mention all the people that could be innocent but we may never actually know. And that itself is a pretty fucking huge down side.
I don't mind the cost, but the fact that laws change and previous life sentence could be turned into eg. 25 years. Then it's over and you either have to invent new laws to keep them in, or let them go freely. The main thing we should concern ourselves about is safety of people, not well being of monsters.

Something simillar happened in Poland with Mariusz Trynkiewicz, except his amnesty changed death penalty to 25 years - because there was no lifetime sentence. His 25 years was up recently and they invented new laws to keep him locked in special facility, as well as found child porn in his cell as argument. (?! how is that even-)
In Poland it's 100% down to the lawmakers being negligent and not realizing that after removing the death penalty in 1989 they didn't change the maximum possible sentence, that is 25 years. 

They left it as it was instead of introducing a life sentence in it's place and after the laws were passed it was too late to reverse that. That's why they were left with the worst criminals being released from prison. Not because a death penalty was ever a good idea.
But we can see that some of them just can't be resocialized, cannot be reformed, cannot be changed, fixed and ever released. There is always slight chance they will escape. Why keep them alive, what does anyone, including the offender, gain from that?
You can reverse that and say that some can be resocialized, can be reformed, can be changed, fixed and released. And killing a person like that is way worse than keeping the worst offenders locked up under life sentences.

Arguing that a death sentence is better than life in prison is saying more about the failure of the prison system than it is about the validity of taking someone's life away. Polish prisons are notoriously poorly run and a death penalty is a short sided attempt at addressing that. The whole system needs a reform instead of just letting it continue and getting rid of the people the government deems worthy of killing. 

If you're Polish (actually even if you're not), I recommend watching "Krótki film o zabijaniu" [("A Short Film About Killing")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_Film_About_Killing). It sparked a heated debate about the capital punishment in Poland and offers a good starting point for the discussion.
I don't see the problem. Unless you fuck up royally while changing the law to 25, it just won't occur. Look at Germany for example: Someone sentenced to life in prison can be released after 15 years in case of good behavior. After that they can try it every 2 years. *But:* Extreme cases (aka. extremely violent offenders etc) that would be a threat after release don't get released. They serve a literal life sentence.

Your argument is just plain stupid. "We need the death penalty in case we ever change the law so stupidly that we miss the most obvious problem that would need to be adressed while changing it." You essentially want to kill people just because you think your fellow citizens may be fucking morons. Your own example shows that it's ridiculous. "Oh no, whatever could we do with the guy we would've needed to keep locked up?" "Keep him locked up?" "Wow, I never would've thought of that!"

If you need an exception, just make one. Don't go around killing people just because you don't feel like picking up a pen.
I don't want to kill people, I want to kill monsters. To remove any possibility they would 3ver be released, or escape 
That's your problem right there, no how monstrous the crime may be it would still be committed by a person, by a human you keep thinking of them as monsters just to make it easier to justify killing them.
I didn't make them into monsters, they did. Tough shit, but I won't have any empathy or compassion for child rapists or murderers.
Do you seriously think a person turns themselves into a troubled person, just shows how little compassion you have for people that you don't even bother to question what causes someone to commit horrific crimes, you'd rather just have them killed rather than examined.
Oh yes, thoughts and feelings of mass murderers and child rapists should be our top priority. 

Whatever pushed them, sure, examine them, try to find out what happened. Maybe we can prevent that in the future. But right now some of them are nothing but a ticking time bomb and danger to the world. Should I cry over the fate of John Wayne Gacy? Should I feel sorry for him? Do you feel sorry for him? Because I don't. He got what was coming for him, and it wasn't even what he deserved.
Why do you care if we kill monsters so badly?
Because i don't see anyone as monsters, no matter the crime they're still human.
Still human shouldn't be reason enough to never be executed.
> It is like the child who is raped is given a death sentence themselves at the point of their rape.

Your understanding of the statistics is a little skewed. *most* perpetrators were victims, but only a minority of victims go on to become perpetrators.


I agree with th programs for victims though. You can never have too many victim support programs.
But the problem seems to be lack of enforcement, rather than lack of punishment.  If we accept that potential rapists aren't taking the punishment into account right now, then we have to accept that they won't take the punishment into account with the new law either, and what this law change does is to create the potential for a person to be wrongfully identified as a rapist and executed.  If India wants to tackle the problem of rape in their country, they'll need to do a lot better than this kind of knee-jerk feel-good legislating.

^(I'm not saying that they aren't doing more that the article says, just that the actions described in the article are a lateral move at best, and a reactionary step back at worst)
What is funny to me is that every time India is mentioned a bunch of intellectuals will jump in saying India has a rape problem but none of them have ever dealt with Indian court and the most of the women who file rape cases. Every time someone mentions Nirbhaya (that wasn't her name, Google it) and rakes infinite karma.

As a person who actually works with men who have been accused of crimes against women, the unreported reality is that most rape cases are filed by women who can't acknowledge their affair with someone of lower caste and as is often the case, lower economic status. India considers sex on the pretext of marriage as rape, and because of 1 case - ONE CASE - that was promoted all over by English speaking Indians ashamed of their roots, millions of men are sent to jail for months without a possibility of bail lest judiciary be laughed at for 'being not serious against rapists'.

Furthermore, unlike western countries, Indian judiciary is notoriously curropt where murderers often go free and gangsters become politicians while living lavishly inside jail. The murderous self-righteousness dripping from people who 'stand with Nirbhaya' and demand 'death penalty for rapists' don't have balls to acknowledge that they or their friends do get caught in similar situations but can get away by throwing money, and the only people who will end up spending rest of their lives are those poor men who can't come to reddit to defend themselves.

Most importantly, I am not saying that India doesn't have rapes, but the idea that India has some rape problem is fiction.

If anyone thinks I am talking out of my ass, pm me for proofs. I am a simple techie btw who volunteeres and plans to create a documentary about this issue. 
Not trying to be rude: what makes you say that India has a serious rape problem? 

How is India worse off statistically than other nations?
Statistically I don't think India has a rape problem, people fail to realize how big 1.4 billion is. Per capita levels would'nt indicate a rape problem let alone a serious one. 

The thing is that many rapes go unreported, but even if this were included i don't think statistically India would be among the worst. Unfortunately there is no way of proving this. 
I like that multiple people mentioned contradicting statistics but no one has any numbers
Welcome to India!
The police comes out with numbers (me thinks it's the National  Crime Records Bureau) - they're (admittedly correctly) disputed by most people since rapes are under reported and / or no charges are filed with the police.

Edit: http://ncrb.gov.in
If you've been reading headlines over the past five years, the burden is on you to provide evidence that they're rape problem isn't statistically any worse than other nations. Because there have been so very many headlines.

Seriously though, I've noticed that narcissism in Indians males is an enormous national problem.
Headlines =/= statistics
This is called a salience bias in statistics . Please do not go by number if headlines. As someone rightly pointed out below , it’s difficult to get correct statistics on this issue, but relying on headlines to draw inferences would not be a valid method of substantiating the claim. 
This. I wanted to say this - thanks!
Conversely, it would be wrong to think that headlines play no role in the judgments people make about how their country is doing.
I agree as an Indian myself , we do have a big rape problem n it ain't going to solve itself by pointing fingers at someone else's country. N the bigger problem is law enforcement , with India most of the times rapists go free or uncaught or totally unreported.

 N yes the narcissism too. 
How have you assumed my gender and my nationality? Also, why the ad hominem attack?
It's hard to actually compare the statistics between countries. What qualifies as rape and thus gets reported differs by country. Or if a victim is raped repeatedly by an individual, does that get reported as one rape or multiple? Not to mention the amount of unreported rapes that can depend on the culture. I would imagine women/girls are less likely to report rapes in an environment where they would be blamed or even punished.
I agree with you.

Even a single incidence of rape is one rape too many, however, my point was that this idea that India has a "serious" rape problem is not proven.

Since rape is an emotive topic, I'll end this discussion here.

What is goog
>How many even know that the event that started India on the warpath against rape was the gangrape/murder of a woman nicknamed Nirbhaya?


Most of them? The 2012 Delhi rape was huge international news, to the point that I can recall details without having to look it up again to verify. 




How aware are these other redditors? On a normal scale of 0 to 10 the answer is probably -100. A vast majority of them have never set foot in India. Probably even a larger # of them can't tell you 1/2 of it's neighboring country. The responses you read are typical when pretty much 100% of their knowledge on another country matter is through reddit and occasionally online news...they try to think how such law would do in their country (likely US for most reading this)...
Murder occurs in a relatively small number of cases, think about family members raping a girl they won't kill her. Rape in the family is pretty common as it is proven that a culprit is usually known to the victim and is not any stranger in most cases.
4 guys not 10
reading you guys' comments make me feel really uncomfortable...

You're basically saying
"it's not like rape victims get so fucked up that they die anyway, sooooo the argument about 'more likely to get killed' doesn't really matter"


What twisted logic.
How is that twisted logic?

Q: Won’t this punishment cause more murder?

A: Statistically, the victims are more often murdered or die, so no.

It’s actually sound logic you don’t have the stomach for.
It definitely is not.


"Statistically, the victims are more often murdered or die, so no."


Are you really trying to say that since victims are often murdered, it is impossible that something could increase the murder rate even further in rape cases?


What the actual fuck, how stupid are you?

And today was the day you discovered something wrong with your ability to logic. But nah...probably not. Those with faulty logic never seem to possess enough logical ability to realize, logically, they’re the one with faulty logic, not that they’re right and everyone else is being ridiculous. 
If you think the law is wrong and they shouldn't be sentenced to death, just say that, it is an understandable to believe the death penalty is wrong in all cases. But don't make up this bullshit about how this is gonna lead to more victims being killed or whatever. 
I am not pretending to know enough to say what I think is wrong or right in this case.


I am simply pointing out the logical flaws that these guys base their comments on..
Who said anything about a "second chance?" Living the rest of your life in prison is not a "second chance." People that don't think prison is a bad punishment, universally dont know what they're talking about.

The only reals deterrent to crime is proactive law enforcement. The end. All death penalties do is satiate blood lust and vengeance. It has ZERO to do with justice.
And there is actual social value in sating that desire for vengeance. If the citizens can read about it in the paper and collectively say "he got what he deserved", the death penalty has served its purpose.

The death penalty isn't meant to be a deterrent. It's a way for the government to reassure everyone else that this behavior is not tolerated.
A lot of the citizenry are also not saying that. And for years the death penalty has been used as a deterrent, maybe what you suggest is also a reason. But it's not the only one.

Vengeance can't be justice. And with an imperfect system, you end up putting innocent people to death. Proactive law enforcement does everything that you say the death penalty can do.

That supposed social value is lost in the long run when we sacrifice our soul to "feel" safe. Texas has the highest death penalty rate in the Union. They're citizens don't feel any more safe or reassured than citizens in Oregon and the crime rate isn't any lower than the national average.
Overall, this push for the death penalty was the public's doing. The executive order was the government's way to appease protests.

I also completely fail to understand what "sacrifice your soul" means. I may believe that all people are equal in general, but it does not mean that I see every single person in this world as equal. Everyone draws the line somewhere, and drawing the line at child rapist shouldn't be controversial at all.

And sending a message is different from feeling safe (which is the point of deterrence). The point of the death penalty is not to say "don't worry, there are no child rapists" but rather that "don't worry, you live in a society where child rapists will receive zero leniency".
Life in prison isn't leniency. That isn't how leniency works. I can't speak for India, and maybe that's my mistake.

"Sacrifice your soul" means that you're degrading your morals to feel safe. And make no mistake, living in a society where you feel child rapists getting zero "leniency" is still part of feeling safe and is primarily emotional; Devoid of logic. Using immoral and inhumane techniques to "feel" safe, erodes at the core of a society. Not tomorrow, but in the long run. Being safe or contributing to a safe society is not the same as a policy that makes you _feel_ safe or appear safe.

Deterrence isn't to _feel_ safe. It's to actually empirically make a community safer by making criminals not commit a crime based off a potential consequence of doing that crime. It either empirically work, or it doesn't. The death penalty has been proven to not actually work in that regard.
Maybe they're really into JusticePorn.
I took it to mean that the average conviction rate going up could mean that fewer cases were coming to the courts, only the really obvious ones, while the cases where it isn’t obvious and social pressure is too great don’t come before the court. So, higher conviction rate but lower % of victims see justice. 
Scores are often hidden on the bigger subs for a set amount of time after posting (usually an hour or so).

It's supposed to prevent blind-voting/crowd-voting, but it doesn't really work.
Can't be certain. There are many gender specific laws in both India and other countries. 
In a lot of places in the West until quite recently (even 2000s) boys could not legally be "raped", and "sodomy" or sexual assault charges were brought instead. 
I don't get argument because one gender is more affected law should be more severe for them.Both genders suffer the same trauma even if one gender makes minority of victims.
That wasn’t the argument at all, and I agree with you wholeheartedly.
There are many gender specific laws against molestation and rape in both India and other countries. His concern is well founded.
My understanding is that it's the literal meaningful wording put into the laws. The laws are specifically worded so that a man molesting a child gets one punishment while a woman doing the same thing gets a much lighter or no punishment at all.  


>This comment is the definition of whataboutism.

No it isn't. I see no indication of the commenter trying to discredit the executive order.
It really isn’t. Not at all. You should look up whataboutism for a refresher. 
I wouldn't say it's NOT a problem, male rape have happened here. But they aren't reported nearly enough due to various factors(society, parental pressure, fear of humiliation, sec 377), so that's why the rape of a boy isn't really considered by the population. It's a bit messed up, but Baby Steps. 
This. They never said raping young boys is acceptable. All the article says is that the raping of young girls is a problem; the other thing might just not happen enough to be considered one.
>how can we as a society say that you can't kill someone but since you did we are going to kill you?

I mean, that isn't inherently hypocritical.

If I take you against your will and lock you in my warehouse, even if I feed you and all, it's a crime. But if the government, on deciding that you have committed a crime, locks you in prison, it's not.

Same deal.
I think it might be more to do with the nature of sex crimes than anything.  Whenever child rapists are talked about there's no shortage of revenge fantasies brewing in the comments.
I've recently been considering the possibility that reddit is comprised of more than one person or group. Could be wrong.
From what I’ve seen in this comment section, I’d have to disagree.
Seriously! Well, at least Reddit is being consistent in its inability to grasp the difference between individuals and entire populations.
Reddit is only against the death penalty for things they like. In reality it is extremely authoritarian and far left.

So treason is excusable, war crimes are dodgy, anything of the topic of the day is also good.

But being a pedo, rapist, accused of sexual misconduct, or being Donald Trump is a crime punishable by death, often accompanied by explanations of why they should be tortured first. 

Varies by sub, but this would be how the front page leans. 
These posts just scream "I don't use Reddit." Anything to do with harming children is really the only thing I see the vast majority of people having no sympathy for. Regardless the site isn't one single unit. Everyone has varying views and beliefs. Not everyone chooses to comment on every post.
lol, go back to /r/LateStageCapitalism

Random 20 year old college students with no life experience are far more wrong. 
Random 20 year old obsessed with reddit is less wrong when talking about reddit.
Reddit tends to be okay with the death penalty if it’s the rape of a child (12ish and under). And Americans in general give hella support for vigilantism. So if someone rapes your kid and you kill them, no matter the time, that’s fine and you should walk. 
What - in your opinion - would actually help?
Make it double-death so they pick rape over murder.
i wholly disagree with the people saying this law is bad because it incentivizes murder BUT what you're saying wouldn't help because it's still better for them to just burn the little girl than it is to keep her alive
It was an accident!
Tough to prove anything without a witness or much evidence.
I really don't see the problem with the state executing proven rapists and murderers when there's no doubt that the person is guilty.

I live in canada where the majority of people are against the death penalty, people argue that the role of prisons is to rehabilitate and reform criminals and put them back as productive members of society. Yet people also ask for sexual predators registry, maps of known ex predators and every job interview will ask for your criminal record.

If people truly believed in the judicial system, we wouldn't need criminal records and a former rapist should be able to get a job anywhere... But most people are hypocritical and don't actually believe that a man who raped his children and murdered his whole familly can be rehabilitated, they just want the good conscience of saying they are against capital punishment.

Murder is murder. But killing isn’t always murder. 
I agree. I think that's why we should, at least for the most part, stop doing it. 
Locking people up? 
It’s taking an animal off the earth forever. Fuck child rapists 
Great, now I have to feel like I'm defending them.

They are still people and still deserve basic human rights just like everyone else, despite being absolutely awful people. If you want to claim to be morally superior to these terrible people, you can't turn around and encourage killing them.


You forfeit for right to life the second you Fuck a child 
Death for them would be the easy way out, a lifetime in jail is far worse in every way.

Also, are you willing to accept innocents being killed as a result? If an innocent person is convicted of such a crime and then put to death, are you okay with that?
Are you ok with innocents spending a lifetime in prison? You just admitted yourself that it’s worse in every way. You have to have faith in the justice system, and allow an appeal to be 100% sure. A lifetime sentence is very seldom given to child predators and they have an EXTREMELY low rehabilitation rate. Also take into account how expensive it is to keep somebody in prison for 20-30-40 years. Why waste tax money on rapists that essentially cannot be rehabilitated??? 
I would much prefer an innocent spent their life in jail than killed, as for as long as they are in jail they still have the opportunity to be let free and found as innocent. 

It's way more expensive to give someone the death penalty due to all the legal stuff required beforehand, unless that is lowered which will result in more innocent convictions.

Also, if there is a low rehabilitation rate, that doesn't mean they cannot be rehabilitated. 
People like you are the reason the issue will never be resolved. Over 90% will attack again, and it is much more expensive to keep them in prison. Also with modern dna testing it’s pretty fucking hard to be convicted of rape if you are innocent. If they find your dna they find your dna. Imagine if your kid got ass raped by some dude and it turns out he’s been in and out of prison yet they never stopped him. Stop defending these animals 
I'm a victim of childhood sexual assault and I don't believe this. 
You don’t believe statistical facts? Lol
How is you saying "someone who rapes a child deserves to die" a statistical fact? 
You responded to my comment that was talking about the stats dummy.

A country that also has huge amounts of corruption in their justice system. 
Yeah this is political theater. If the government takes this issue seriously they need to get serious about ending child marriages and start trying to enact social change. 
>Instead of this, they should make it so that  any law enforcement personnel who refuse to file rape complaints or who  deliberately botch an investigation, any judge who clearly fails in  their duty to uphold the law, will be treated as if they are party to  the crime itself.

And then you will just end up with law enforcers feeling the heat to prosecute \(and convict\) people even on the flimsiest of cases, like the word of one person with no empirical evidence. How would you suggest implementing that without having it that anyone, anywhere could face the death penalty on the word of a 12 year old?
18 and 21 are two arbitrary ages in the west. Why can people be adult enough to fight in wars but not drink.
I think 12 is used as an age to separate teens from children.    
The Indian government is usually not very keen to extend the death penalty to other crimes.    
This seems like a compromise of sorts.
How?
Because it's uncivilized barbarism that makes society less safe, sometimes causes horrible injustice, and exists only to satisfy the worst revenge impulses of people who are only looking for excuses to dehumanize others.
Isn't raping a child also not uncivilized barbarism?
Do you believe that two acts of uncivilized barbarism somehow cancel out?
They don't cancel out, but these law act as deterrent for such crimes..
That seems to be working really well, considering intentional homicide rates are more than four times higher in the US than in Germany, where there's no death penalty...
LOL I GUESS THATS WHY WE HAVE NO CRIME NOW LOLOLOLOL 
No I personally believe rapists and peadophiles (who indulge in it since I know it’s a disorder which can’t helped) are unable to be reformed or treated and don’t deserve to be treated as human because of their actions. So instead of wasting the tax payers money disposing them off is a better idea. Just like how you euthanise any rabid animal. 
Shouldn't we strive to be better than people who rape children?
By giving them food three times a day, shelter and treatment which may or may not work and let them live in society again after some years? 
No that don’t solve any problem. How would you strive to do better, you need to give them appropriate punishment which is required. 
Your opinion sounds very good on book but have you ever met rape victims and their families? Do you actually know the damage which is done or are just a viewer from far away preaching morals? 
Because death penalty is bullshit. 

Edit : I can't believe that people still think [death penalty](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Capital_punishment#Opposition) is a [good idea](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Essay:Against_the_Death_Penalty#The_Invocation_of_Religion). 
You think men that rape and murder children should be left alive?
That's a tough moral question but ultimately yes, the person should live. There is no point in being civilized and advenced society while still believing that death is an answer or even an deterrent. There are many laws today all over the world which have the death penalty and those laws are still broken. It's not about the law or the punishment. It's the desperation of the person breaking the law.  The only way to combat this is to reform the person, show them where they went wrong , try to help them and fix them, **no matter how bad their act is.**
There is no civility or morality is condemning a person to death over [what society currently believes is right. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty)
If we want to truly progress and evolve, we can't let emotions form out laws or dictate our judgement. We can become better through reformation, not death

Edit : Spelling
You say that as though they're not punished. Killing them won't get rid of the problem either. The death penalty is a simplistic idea. It's on the same level as your dumb uncle wishing we would just nuke the middle east. You're just killing people because you think it makes your problems go away. It doesn't. The death penalty isn't a deterrent. No child rapist is thinking about the consequences of their actions before they go through with them. Studies have shown as much. 
What about innocent people being sentenced to death? 
I personally believe they’d have to guaranteed guilty to be sentenced to death.
That's what everyone thinks but even so people are innocently jailed for life or given the death penalty still 
I'm not a person who supports the death penalty but that's with great ambivalence toward child rapists. Even so, I tend to be skeptical of conviction which increases my view of the dealth penalty being bad.
Yes. Rehabilitation is always preferable. And even if it weren’t, leaving someone in prison makes more sense from a lot of standpoints than just killing people who commit crimes.
No one should be killed. Period.
So a  terrorist who is a responsible for the death of 100s of innocent people be kept alive and fed on taxpayers money?
Even Hitler, if captured alive, should not have been killed. He instead should have worked off rest of his miserable life doing hard labor and paying for his and other older inmates. 

If inmates can't support themselves then we as society are responsible for keeping them alive. Because we as society decided to incarcerate them (or kill them in your case). 

If you don't know what to do with something, you can't just kill it.
What if a person raped your child? 
In case you actually want a good answer to this question. You should watch the documentary Breaking the Cycle on Netflix. The guy who made it also did a Reddit AMA a few months ago or sometime as well.

I’ll check it out. Thanks
Then me as a person would want them killed. My government should not.
Why not?
Because governments, and societies in general, should be better than individual citizens who are motivated by revenge?
I don’t see how having a different opinion to someone makes them “better”
Because governments can't go around killing people because someone wants them killed. Governments aren't hitmen.
I don't think anybody has the right to kill someone, regardless of who they are and what they have done. 

Sorry, European education.
What would you propose happens to these rapists and murderers? And European education? I was born and raised in England.
Oh, sorry, it''s just that usually, circlejerking about the merits of the death penalty is an American thing.
Have you heard of something called "prison"?
Yes. And they can be released from prison free to wander the earth and rape/kill another innocent child. 
...or be released from prison because it turns out they were innocent.
Moving the goalposts.
So why not advocate for a life sentence instead of death penalty?
 I don’t think they deserve to live. That’s the whole point of my argument
Aww, how nice of you to think of the rights of rapists and murderers. Surely that's more important than kids that were raped and killed, and kids who will be again and again.

Volenti non fit iniuria
Instead we can just ignore people's right and murder them, that's what a modern society should do right?
Again, if they chose to commit atrocities well knowing what is the punishment, they should not cry about it being unfair. And why do you care more about rapists and murderers than their victims and possible future victims is beyond me.
I mean, the whole point of human rights is that they're the rights of all humans, right ? That's just what I'm saying. 
Death penalty as a criminal punishment system is a bad idea. Always. In all cases.
I like how you said that as if it were some QED knockdown argument. Yes, I in fact do think this because I’m not some barbarian.
Right, me believing apathetic monsters that would rape and kill children have a place on our planet makes me a Barbarian. Sure! Don’t resort to name calling because I disagree with you
If you want people to be murdered you are a Barbarian. 
Ok.
Just men? Because women never ever molest children. 
Sure gank women rapists too
the death penalty has never been about deterrent, its about revenge.
This is what disappoints me the most, as an Indian man.

Reading or hearing that "India has a rape culture" feels bad. But it isn't wrong either. 

The only solution that comes up during regular conversation is educating the coming generation about this.

The generation already grown, needs to be restrained. We will see how far this ordinance goes to help towards this.
The same way other countries did it.  Drag the issue out into the open, create support structures for victims, educate the population, step up enforcement of existing laws, actively seek out abusers instead of waiting for reports all the time.  It's a process that's expensive and will take years to show appreciable results, requiring shifting the attitudes of an entire generation of Indians.

But since that's really hard, we'll probably just see knee-jerk reactions like this that don't really do much.
>  I am really confused here, why does India have a rape culture 

India has 53 million more men than women. For many men, the only way they'll have sex with a woman is if they rape her.

I'm not saying it excuses their actions, but those men do.

What attitude do Indian men have toward Women, is a good place to start. Do they see them as property or as equals?

From what I understand using old knowledge; Indian boys are actively made to be 'separate' from girls so they never actually interact with them. It's only until they are men that they end up married to one. It's an extremely unhealthy attitude that can foster all sorts of shit.
No fear. People know they'll get away with it. I was in UAE for work a few months ago. Sometimes cases or child rape shows up on the paper. He'll be given a death sentence within a week, and the execution will be carried out the very next day early morning. No mercy. You need to have some casualties to set an example. Need to impose fear to the people here. You rape or murder a child? Be ready to die. 

I feel the same goes for these "honor killings". The people behind them should be executed and publicised through out the country so everyone can see it. If you're willing to kill someone, be ready to get killed.

Need to send a clear cut message through out the country. Put up bill board warnings through out the country. Isn't it for a good cause/precaution?
Massive population. Even if the incidence of rape is comparable per capita with other nations the amount of rapes would be exponentially more.
I can provide my personal reason to that, so listen the thing is most of India’s population still live in rural areas, where inequality as at its peak most of the wealthy guys have power many of farmers in India, many of those wealthy lack basic manners or as you say humanity , they literally rape their workers or their daughters, now here even if these guys rape these people these people can’t go to the police because even they are corrupted by the rich guys. So you see how helpless they are.
If you think your country, whichever one it is, does not have a rape culture, you're sadly mistaken. 
Don't even bother, the only time news about India is allowed to reach the front page is if it's negative. So now reddit has this completely skewed perception of the country as a whole.
I don't really care what the punishment is. That's not the point.
Not only are most rapes not reported, Indian laws for rape and the way law enforcement and society works ensures that many kinds of rape simply don't get recorded. Marital rape still isn't really a part of criminal law and it's not counted in sexual assault crime figures. If there is any situation where the victim knows the perpetrator and it can be proved that they had a previous relationship the case will generally be laughed out of the police station unless you are in very specific affluent parts of the country, and you have connections. The standard practice is to label it as a sort of 'lover's quarrel' (closest translation from Indian languages), or to suggest that the woman has a bad 'character'.

The arranged marriage and dowry system often causes the sexual assault of minors to just almost never be reported at all. This is naturally a very unique problem in India.

There was a recent documentary on how society in Haryana perceives sexual assault, it really tells you how backward parts of India are:

https://www.thequint.com/videos/documentaries/rape-is-consensual-inside-haryanas-rape-culture

Ideas of consent are completely alien in places like this.

Per capita rape statistics are extremely misleading. And comparative crime stats themselves are not too useful when looking even at different states within India, let alone different countries. Some of the most backwards Indian states like UP and Bihar have very low crime rates.

Rape is measured differently in different parts of the world. Laws differ, reporting rates differ and the way in which sexual assault crime is recorded differs.

Does anyone seriously think Belgium, Netherlands, New Zealand and Australia has more rape than Sudan, Bangladesh, Sierra Leone, Yemen, Syria and Mozambique? Because that's what these statistics will lead you to believe: [1](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Violent-crime/Rapes-per-million-people), [2](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Australia/Sudan/Crime)

The rape per capita argument has always been a mainstay of Indian nationalist propaganda, and BJP (the current ruling party) has ministers that echo this:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/23/indias-problem-exaggerated-says-minister-for-women-maneka-gandhi

There are a couple of sorts of people that try to downplay India's rape problem:

1. Indian nationalists that think India's honor is under siege, so defending that honor at any cost; even with lies; is kosher.
2. Indians living in an affluent urban bubble or migrant Indians that are so removed from the rest of the country they don't see how big of a shithole most of the country is.
3. SJWs from the West that are similarly clueless about the ground reality in India.
4. (Indian) MRAs who will remind you how gender-biased Indian laws are.
Not just India, globally rapes go unreported, so sorry to burst your bubble.
That might have been true a decade ago in backward villages but not anymore. People have access to Internet. It is easier to get attention now. After the nirbhaya rape case, you can see that people are agitated. They want their voices heard.

she was 2 weeks shy of 14, the irony after that initial comment, lol.
One of Roy Moore's accusers was 14 when he molested her. Not much of a difference.
It was sadly viewed as life in the business back in the day. Look at Steven Tyler, Iggy Pop, Ted Nugent, Jerry Lee Lewis, to name just a few of the dozens who had open relationships with 13-15 year olds. The oddest part is that many of the parents condoned these relationships. 
I guess 14 is a bit older? 
C'mon, it wasn't *rape rape.

The Roman Polaski girl/women did a reddit AMA and it didn't go like the narrative said it would.  

> I know for a fact that the Judge Rittenband lied to Roman and his attorney, the judicial misconduct that occurred is beyond belief. Any person in their right mind would have fled rather that trust a Judge engaged in such bizarre behavior and who had lied twice before. There was to be no trial, just a plea deal broken by the Judge. I would like him to be sentenced to time served, in absentia if necessary, and then get an apology from from the DAs office after they are forced to investigate and the truth sees the light of day.

What the courts and the media did to me, and now him, that's what's hard to forgive. I didn't have today's lens to look at what was happening then, it was a very different time to be growing up in.  


But Roy Moore is republican. 
Haven’t we realised that kiddy fucking is a ‘non-partisan issue’ by now ? Jeez 
Is that why the international media reports with equal fervor on the endemic rape and murder of Christian children in Pakistan? 

Open your eyes.

All that is required to determine with a high degree of accuracy whether the international community will condemn or turn a blind eye to crimes against children is the race and religion of the perpetrators and the race and religion of the victims.
>Is that why the international media reports with equal fervor on the endemic rape and murder of Christian children in Pakistan?

I'd say that's more because Pakistan never makes it onto the radar of most Redditors' media, full stop. It's not so much that they don't give a shit about rape in Pakistan particularly, just that they don't give a shit about Pakistan overall enough to give it that sort of news coverage. 
> I'd say that's more because Pakistan never makes it onto the radar of most Redditors' media

Is it?

Most Redditors couldn't identify a single internal region of Pakistan or India on a map. That doesn't explain why the ethno-religiously motivated rape and murder of a child in an obscure border region of India receives intense headline news coverage around the world while numerous ethno-religiously motivated rapes and murders of children of the same age just across the border in Pakistan receive no coverage at all. And you can't argue that Pakistan isn't newsworthy, because the non ethno-religiously motivated rape and murder of a young Pakistani girl made headlines news around the world ([NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/world/asia/pakistan-zainab-amin-imran-ali.html)).

Let's examine the pattern here:

* Rape and murder of child belonging to [ethno-religious identity A] by a member of [ethno-religious identity A]: deemed internationally newsworthy.

* Rape and murder of child belonging to [ethno-religious identity A] by a member of [ethno-religious identity B]: deemed internationally newsworthy.

* Rape and murder of child belonging to [ethno-religious identity B] by a member of [ethno-religious identity A]: deemed not newsworthy.

Who determines what makes it onto the radar of most Redditors' media ('newsworthiness') and why does it seem like they are biased for or against specific ethno-religious groups?

There appears to be a pervasive pattern of bias that extends to events that are absolutely on the radar of most Redditors' media, i.e. events taking place in the US and Western Europe. 

Pakistani Christian children are not only targeted for ethno-religiously motivated crimes in Pakistan, they are targeted in the UK as well. Were you aware that Hindu, Sikh, and Pakistani Christian minority communities in Britain attest they have been the targets of ethno-religiously motivated crimes against children ["for decades"](https://labourlist.org/2017/09/champion-should-have-been-kept-in-shadow-cabinet-religious-leaders-tell-corbyn/)? Probably not - because the media has studiously avoided reporting it.
Maybe to normal people? But this is reddit... being republican is the only thing worse than kiddy fucking.
Ron Paul is republican and he was Reddit's toyboy for ages. 
So was Face book 
They probably didn’t know he was a republican. You should go check that The Mueller page, it’s hilarious seeing a bunch of dems praise the guy, then occasionally get reminded that’s he a republican and then retreat into “well ... umm... I don’t agree with any of his politics but...” (yet you’re hanging out on a sub dedicated to him all day ?) 
Wow, strawman much? There are plenty of Democrats who recognize that there still exist republicans dedicated to the rule of law who haven’t been sucked into the cult of personality. People are well aware that Mueller is republican.
I hope so. That’s just my observation (I’m not even a yank so it’s an observation from afar you could say) 

There just seems to be such a divide, especially with young people who have convicted themselves that republican = the most evil thing imaginable  
So if someone's a Dem and they praise a Repub for being exceptional or doing the right thing they're stupid?  

Yeah, you aren't blinded by party politics at all, uh huh.

Then they will be double dead.  
:( they make child and infant sized gyno equipment so the damage cause by an adult can be documented.  Pre puberty sexual abuse usually has a very specific set of physical signs, due to the victim's small size - micro tears (or large tears),  abrasions, specific types of bruising. Plus DNA left behind. 

:(
With great difficulty.
People commit crimes assuming they won't get caught. They're not going to commit necrophilia because a potentially different sentence.
Killing and then raping, that deserves death penalty as well just as well if it was other way around.
Most of the time, rapists like this get off on power over their victim. Not just sexual gratification, especially in places where rape as a punishment is widespread. So there wouldn’t be much of an interest in raping someone who isn’t afraid of them anymore. 
Sadly not, it was a topic in one of my classes during my social work study.
Finally someone who sees it right.

 It isn't "Hey, if I add murder to this, I *may* not get the death sentence."

It's,"Well, since rape can get me a death sentence, I might as well kill the victim/witness."
Exactly. I don't think any potential child rapists are doing a cost benefit analysis of whether or not to rape a young kid, who are now going to say "death penalty? That sounds pretty harsh, guess I'll have to stick with consenting adults. Oh well!" It's ridiculous. So I don't think anyone thinks this will *prevent* anything. 

But *after* they do it? Yeah, then the gears will start turning about punishment, and they might decide their odds of getting away with it are better if there are no witnesses.
Or just throw the body in the Ganges river where it can blend in with all the other bodies.
Ahahahahaha! :'(
I wish I was joking.
It's a pretty simple process to determine if someone was raped with an autopsy, from what I understand. It's a pretty violent act. 
was that your yearbook quote
life protip?
I am very sure it is gender neutral now(recent) for children but for adults rape is still defined as something a man can commit on a woman. However, Section 377 penalises any 'Unnatural offences' which any other rape case would fall under but it is also the section which outlaws lgbt+ relationships.

This is the comment where logic goes to die. 
>While I'm sure plenty of boys get raped in India (source: I live there) and everywhere else, it's not worth bringing up this point when the relative proportion of females getting raped (and also aborted) is so damn high.

What does the relative proportion of something happening to a specific demographic have to do with the law? That sounds like such a strange statement. If boys were included in that law then how would that take attention away from girls?
No, this is sexism and ignorance.

First of all just because there is a supposedly bigger issue it doesn't mean that a smaller issue shouldn't be addressed.

Secondly, when it comes to rape and especially underage rape I'm willing to bet that the ratio of boys and girls raped is about the same.

Thirdly, if you would be an underage boy that was raped you wouldn't "take one for the team", and I doubt that hearing that your rapist will be free or receive a pitiful penalty compared to what he could get if you were a girl would make you happy.

Adding to that, what's the deal with just not adding 'girl' to the law and keep it valid for both genders? Does it cost the lawmakers money to not add 'girl'? Do underage male rape victims don't deserve justice because "there is a bigger issue"?

Lastly, what does abortion have to do with this?
>Secondly, when it comes to rape and especially underage rape I'm willing to bet that the ratio of boys and girls raped is about the same.

This is absolutely wrong in India and wouldn't even make sense. If you go outside into villages or even among the urban poor/uneducated in large parts of the country, women are just seen as property. Husbands think wives should be disciplined so they beat them. wives refer to their husbands reverentially rather than by name. If you're not from India you should look at the broader context in which these laws were made and how much pressure it took to actually pass them.

While I'm not saying that male rape does not exist/should not be included in the law, good luck trying to make two massive shifts in worldview to sexist lawmakers instead of one. It can't be done yet because people still believe that boys can't be raped.

As for abortion there's a bit of history to that in India, that in some states in India, female babies tend to be unwanted and get aborted/killed at birth. The government has outlawed sex determination of babies to prevent this but there's still work to be done

Edit: for a read regarding the abortion issue [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female\_infanticide\_in\_India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_infanticide_in_India)

If you're not from India you should look at the broader context in which these laws were made and how much pressure it took to actually pass them.

How is this proof to anything? People who prey on underage children often don't discriminate between males and females (that sounds so wrong, but I hope you get the point), why would it be any different in India?
It could most certainly be different in India if the cultural context is different. If men believe females are property, they may be more inclined to do whatever they want to them. Men who would not be predators if they grew up in a culture of equality may not believe it is rape to have sex with a young girl. If their culture is telling them it is OK, they have very little reason not to do it.

Of course, there are predators who would victimize boys, but if boys are intrinsically more valued by a culture, it is likely that they will be victimized less often. Of course, data would be helpful but it's not an unrealistic assumption.
It's not proof in the sense that you can't get beyond reasonable doubt proof without data and the data is terrible regarding male rape. As for your second statement, do you have either proof or an argument supporting it? What I'm trying to make is an argument that this is most likely the case because this is part of the larger context of violent crimes against women in India because they're treated as objects.

But I will concede that protection against child sexual abuse for male children is lacking and female protection has only been accelerated because of the rise in reported rape cases and string of highly publicised recent cases including those against adults in India.

Edit: clarification
Weakling 

>That's what concerns me. If someone were to rape a 12 year old child (Jesus, typing that is not easy), I'm afraid the attacker might decide to murder the victim

I understand your concern, people can be sick like that. In fact the very case that caused this outrage and forced government to come up with this law, involves another abuse of system. The man who came up with the plan of rape and murder of girl, used his nephew, a juvenile, as the main executor of the crime. In India the maximum punishment for a juvenile is 3 years imprisonment.
I think the criminal would just be charged with both rape and murder... 
I'm not exactly sure what you are saying. 

It's very easy to test if rape happened before the murder, and then the attacker will be punished for both. 

So it's either death penalty for rape, or it's death penalty for rape + additional penalty for murder.
> the attacker might decide to murder the victim in order to possibly circumvent the death penalty if caught.

That's not how laws work. That's not at all how laws work.
It is if by committing the murder the perpetrator reduces the chance of being convicted of rape by removing some or all evidence. 
Uh... It can be forensically proven after death that it was rape
Even if the body has been mutilated beyond recognition? Covered in petrol and burnt? They only find a head?
oops now all the rapists are arsonists as well.
Notwithstanding destruction of evidence, it doesn't matter if that's how laws work. All that matters, in this concern, is whether child rapists think that's how laws work.
Laws aren't magic spells that magically devine things.  

Mafia bosses killed their previous underlings to prevent them from testifying against them. 
You can find out medically.
Lawmakers: We should ban bad things

Redditors: WHAT IF THE WORLD DIED
And what of those who are later found to be innocent after they were executed?

My other opposition to this is, killing a person just dehumanizes the people doing it. Protect society by locking away criminals forever but when you kill instead of using that alternative, it hurts the humanity of those doing it \(not just the executioner but the state and everyone who supports the pre\-meditated unnecessary killing\). 
*once you get caught
Yeah can’t rape your victim multiple times when their dead after you raped and killed them the first time...
They aren't very effective because the amount of people who do extreme crimes in a rational way is vanishingly small.

So deterrents make sense looking at the problem in a logical way but the actual actors themselves will not remain true to logic.
because a lot of the perpetrators are damaged themselves by childhood abuse, and lack of any counseling or care for them after the incident, or sense of justice from lack of convicting the perpetrators
Yeah, but there is no place in any society for a man who raped a 11 year old. 
Not true I would have killed 473 people to date.  But there is a law in place that says these turds have rights.
Exactly... that’s why they are going to kill the animals that have sex with 12 year olds and younger. I wish we had something like this in the USA. If you’re Fucking children you have no place in society 
Doesn't matter. That rapist better be dead.
if you're capable of rape and then murder, no amount of laws are going to prevent you from doing that.

But the law will stop who it is intended to stop.
Look at the US. We imprison people for more than most places and have the one of the highest incarnation to to population rates around.

It's almost like making things illegal do next to nothing to deter those who don't think logically about crime. 
deterrents work fine for kind of small misdeeds.  but they don't work very well for especially heinous crimes since the person who does them is already beyond caring about social norms and punishments.  
History has proved this time and time again but we still take the wrong path. 
Switzerland (no death penalty): 0.5 homicides per 100k people

Texas (yes death penalty): 5.3 homicides per 100k people.

If there is a deterrent effect, it's easily overshadowed by other factors, or Texas won't be worse than Switzerland.

Edit:
[Here's a map showing capital punishment](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Minimum_age_for_execution_by_US_state,_pre2005.svg) (green: no, yellow/orange/red: minimum age 18, 17, 16).

[Here's a map showing homicide rates.](http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/US-Murder-Rtae-map.jpg)

My very scientific gut-feeling can't find any strong correlations. 
Well, they often aren't applied at a high enough rate to serve as a deterrent.

If you commit murder the odds you'll receive the death penalty is very very low.
Well, I think this is much more about cultural norms than deterrence. It's actually kind of interesting, while most of the developed world has moved away from using the death penalty at all, adding something to the list is progressive for India. 
Hard to say, punishments in the USA became far more stringent in the early 90s and crime rates have plummeted since then
Ive read several studies that claim that the punishment barely impacts the decision of committing a crime, but the chances of getting caught does heavily. So instead of increasing the punishment, psychologists suggest to more effectively showcase a higher chance of getting caught the more severe the crime is.
Seems to work in Singapore and Malaysia
Deterrents absolutely do work it's only small subsets of crimes of passion and other crimes that it does not work for. You don't want to see how ugly things get if you take away penal laws, especially for violent crimes.

And yes, there's always crazies who'll steal a cookie even if the punishment was death.
100% effective preventing repeat offenses
kind of like how locked doors are more for keeping honest people honest, b/c if someone is determined to get in they are not thinking about the consequences 
Dead people have a zero percent recidivism rate. 

Can you say the same for convicted rapists who remain alive?

Deterrent. Just not in the way you were saying. 
I remember seeing a study that showed assurance of getting caught is a much better deterrent than severity of punishment. People only commit crimes they think they will get away with. 
So why have any laws?
Not sure what y'all are on about, my detergent works great
>So many of the comments talk about fantasies of violence and death.

Ah so I see you've met my American brethren.  Just ignore us - we like to froth at the mouth and scream and stomp and threaten unilateral violence whenever we encounter the appearance of injustice.  
Whenever I hear people say this I am starting to think they are pro child rape honestly
[deleted]
They don't work, period. No matter what you do.
It's universal. Punishments are set as deterrents. Of course they work. There's a consequence for every crime. The only time they don't work is if you threaten, but don't do anything. 
Wrong.
This. One of the biggest problems is that convictions for rape cases in India are abysmally low. I don't think that's likely to change no matter how you amend the laws to make them harsher.
Job opportunities should increase

Instead of basing reservations on caste system , do it on a income basis to pull people out of poverty

Psychiatry and Psychology awareness is nil to barely existent

Centrism or center left ( I hope i am right). Improving the integrity of people. Actions such as the current taxation system is going to create more havoc. We pay the highest tax in the world.


Absolutely right on all counts.

Though I will add the reservation system is so broken and abused, even if it is changed to an income based system, we are never going to see the people who deserve the help getting the help. 

I think that's more of a problem with how we don't give a shit about rules and the law to begin with. Any system to help uplift the poor in India is going to be abused by people already in a position of power and privilege. Just look at how ration cards are handled.
The ration shop gives sugar only if I buy a packaged product from him. So corrupt.

Operant conditioning techniques can help people behave. Its a punishment - reward system based on points. Aadhar can be put to use. Example : if a person participates in volunteering cooking for poor or cleaning, he gets some points. If he does something anti-social, negative points. Fines can be replaced by such a system. If someone drives while drunk, he can be punished by making him participating in creating awareness for the same. And if the total points is less, he should be restricted from some privileges like air travel.

Universal basic income.




You're suggesting what China is implementing: social credit.
which is a good idea if implemented in a transparent way
One more very important thing

We require the government to define an optimal marriage age. The trend now is , people getting married at 27 aboves.

School education can be cut short by an year or two. A chef or a doctor dont need to learn integral calculus. Basic Law and behavioural sciences should be added to the curriculum. Marriage age can be pulled up by an year or two.

Instead of going by classes. A new educational system can be implemented. Subject specific grades with a baseline grade. Like till classes 4 or 5 is a must, and then you can do it by subject wise.

Like to becomea doctor, grade 10 in science along with baseline till class 5 is required.


Okay, I have to ask this...

Are you me, or am I you? Because you're basically saying everything I say and think.

Especially about our education system. I'll also add that we need to remove the marks-oriented K12 system we have and create an education system that gives kids the opportunity to explore their aptitudes, and thereby enable them to pick career paths they are suited for.

This will also help reduce the ridiculous amount of pressure we put on kids because of how important marks are. I mean, what's the point in making first grade examinations hyper-competitive??
It is surprising to find someone receptive and logical

Especially in the indian population , its hard to find logic in people. ( one of the reasons I stopped following r/india)

Nice. Is star trek one of your favourites?
Ha! Don't give me so much credit: I'm as prone to keyboard warrior-ism as anyone online. Just look at my post history - there are a lot of comments there that I wish I didn't make in hindsight. Though I do try to admit my faults when I know I'm at fault. And don't discount r/india yet. Like everywhere, it's a mixed bag. Just need to sift through it all.

I love TNG, not the other series so much. I'm actually more of a Stargate fan.
>  what's the point in making first grade examinations hyper-competitive??

So true. Educational system be AIMED at bring out natural talents.

Competition just restricts knowledge. Competition will equally spread out with increasing opportunities.
> Public executions were the medieval version of scared straight.

And medieval times were staggeringly violent compared to modern times even if you take war out of the equation, probably for the same reasons that are why modern "scared straight" programs don't work either.
Perhaps we are doing the wrong deterrents.  

Take the criminal, and bring them to the town square.  Have it broadcasted on TV/Radio/interwebs and hang them.  Do this for all criminals of harsh crimes, politicians for treason, and any other position of power that abuses said power at the expense of the people.  
You'll notice we've done that before and it did no good. There are countries today with public punishments, including cutting off hands, stoning, hanging, caning, etc, and their crime rates mysteriously have not gone down. 
Then again child rape is much more common where it's not actually punished. Afghanistan and other Muslim countries are a good example with their [bacha bazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacha_bazi).
Yeah but if you kill the child rapist the first time he does it you don't have to deal with them again after they get out 
I had an ex gf who was abused by her uncle and father her entire childhood. According to her the entire family knew about it and nothing happened to stop it. Why are there families where a child's own mother, aunt, and cousins know this is happening without any of them doing a single thing to stop It? According to her, her brothers would watch sometimes and her mother too.
As hard as it was to read, I appreciate the time you took to write it. In order to learn to deal effectively with anyone who might harm others, we should know as much as we can about their motivations and what really will or will not deter them. 
It’s  not right that I had an emotional response and now you are sending me private messages saying that you are going to follow me (after I said I’m sorry). Go ahead and follow me it’s a reddit account that doesn’t bother me so much. But don’t act like you are an “adapted” individual. Yes I am Sorry that I had an angry response but you have to understand that what you wrote is controversial. I dealt with YEARS and YEARS of abuse and I guess I haven’t handled it so well. But please don’t tell private message me saying you’re going to “follow me” that’s so creepy.
> While I don't expect sympathy for this (and don't have any myself), it can quite literally be torture.

thats a rather nice sentiment right there really.

Wow.

I.... just wow.

You're right, I clearly imagined my uncle sucking my cock and eventually wanting to take turns. Thanks for that. Him prompting me to masturbate for him, while sharing titty mags. You're completely right. I guess my unhealed rectum is something imaginary, god I truly love having smeary bits of shit I need to clean from my asshole every few hours.

It only happened because he ended up in a car accident, where he shielded two children with his body and took a piece of engine block to the head. He gained paranoid schizophrenia, and worse because of it.

But clearly you're right, I wasn't abused. I'm just making it fucking up for fake internet points. 

>I think that the pedos should be able to get help.

Yeah, it certainly doesn't read like that. You're not willing to understand the causes and contexts for the actions. Something that I've spent my entire life doing due to my intimate familiarity with the topic.

But thanks for invalidating my abuse, you're a real awesome person. You should be proud of yourself.
I've read through the preceding post a couple of times and missed where he's a pedo apologist.  He compares them to psycopathic murderers with, in a nutshell, something seriously wrong with them that deterrents won't discourage.  

What
Yeah,  this is India though,  seems like they are starting to try to finally do something about their horrible, horrible reputation when it comes to women and children's rights. 

So even if it's not effective at least they are trying
What makes you think that is the intent?  The purpose of the death penalty is most likely to satisfy a societal perception of justice. 
I don't. Just pointing out it doesn't work as a deterrent.
> is extremely hard to deter

No.
Oh okay you're right it's super easy to stop people when sexual desire is involved. Good point. 
Oh yes, everybody rapes like you just claimed.
What?
throwing hyperbole back at the idiot who threw it at me.
Huh?
You just blow in from stupid town, pal?
You aren't improving the discussion by misrepresenting what is being said.

Sex crimes *are* difficult to deter and prevent, which is why the laws and enforcement around them must be very carefully considered.

Getting a child molester to see that molesting children is wrong, and illegal, and will have very bad consequences for them, *still* doesn't prevent them from doing it.

It doesn't mean 'everybody is a rapist', or any such nonsense. It means the drives we are dealing with are powerful, and it's not as simple as putting a death penalty on the crime to stop it.
Where did I say it's super easy to stop people? Why are you not calling the other poster out about this? Oh right, clearly no upvotes in that.

>Getting a child molester to see that molesting children is wrong, and illegal, and will have very bad consequences for them, still doesn't prevent them from doing it.

So from that you get that it is "extremely hard to deter"?

I'd say you said that when you responded with "No" and no further discussion to the statement of sex crimes being hard to deter. What else are people going to take away from that?

I mean come on. 
>Where did I say it's super easy to stop people?

Where did I say you did? If you'd like people to understand your point of view, I would start with not writing one word comments.

I have no idea which other poster you're talking about, and have a grand total of two upvotes for the above comments. Wow, such karma.

Let me turn the conversation around slightly, if child molestation *isn't* extremely hard to deter, then why is it still so prevalent?
I'm starting to wonder if this person even knows what deter means. 
Reading comprehension is hard huh. 
He is not talking about rape. He is talking about sexual drive. The driver which makes most people want to stay healthy, get a good income, be successful etc.. sexual drive is a force for good in healthy individuals. Why did you suddenly think he was just talking about rape?
I think what is being said is that there are some would accept certain death in exchange for the satisfaction of an extremely taboo or harmful sexual obsession.  You are not going to deter them by extreme punishments.
Dexter Morgan
Hopefully Whouiz will stop spewing bullshit though.
Having a particularly terrifying punishment does prevent people from treating the crime as a crime of opportunity. It keeps honest people honest, so even if it won't deter the hard-core bad guys, it keeps honest people from turning to bad guys.
[Germany seems to be on the right track.](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/16/how-germany-treats-paedophiles-before-they-offend)

They treat the sickness *before* a crime is committed, and give access to therapy without jeopardising your entire future.

I don't think this approach will stop the amoral child molesters who may even enjoy causing harm. But those people are probably not going to be deterred by the death penalty either.
If the police doesn't destroy the evidence

Yeah, reading that post shows a scary detachment from a child's life VS feeling better because a rapist is put to death; or just has a greater chance of being caught.
He's saying they wouldn't kill them just because they'd get the death sentence because if anything that would make it easier for them to be caught. He cares about the lives of children you just misunderstood his point.
You need to look at the comment you replied to in the context of the one they were replying to
But now we have a better chance of locking up the pedophilia for life, so that's worth a dead child.  /s

It really is a question of what do we value more, protecting children or seeking revenge on pedophiles.  I feel often people actually want the second option more than the first one.  That is why we have some of the stupid laws around the world (like being caught with child porn often having a larger punishment than being caught molesting a child).
Good grief, what's up with people in this thread? It's like saying "let's steal something from that guy's store after we murdered him, so we only get convicted of stealing, not murder"
And if you happen to be close to the Ganges, there’s a good chance the body will just get mixed up with all the others.
Even fingerprints aren't perfect : 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3093498/

There has been a few people convicted of crimes with hard solid evidences cleared years after when those evidences ended up being not as solid as the judge thought. 

That's the inherent flaw with death sentences.
The problem is that our definition of rock solid evidence changes all the time, which still leaves a possibility for innocent people to be convicted.

At some point, there was a general consensus in the forensic community that bite mark analysis was rock solid evidence. The idea was that like a fingerprint, a bite mark was going to have so many individual details that it could only be linked to a single person. So if you could match the bite mark to a person, they *had* to have done it. Not a single doubt, lock him up, throw away the key, this is rock solid evidence.

Except later we realised that our assumption that bite marks could be linked to a single individiual was based on weak assertions, no evidence and further analysis proved it to be false. Whoops. There goes our rock solid evidence. People had been convicted based on that and were later found to be innocent. If any of those people had been executed already, welp, can't fix that anymore.

Video evidence can be manipulated, finger prints can be matched wrong (they still have to be matched by a person), DNA could point to the wrong person (just because your DNA is on the scene doesn't necesarily have to mean you were involved), eye witnesses are constantly wrong (and we are not just talking about people who saw a guy pass by, even actual victims can identify their attackers wrongly), and confessions aren't worth much when they can be coerced or the result of mental illness. 

We already have a long history of convicting people on rock solid evidence only to realise later they didn't do it. It is not worth the risk. 
Serious question. And I don't lean either way on this matter. Do you think it's fair to execute someone that almost certainly did do a crime vs someone that definitely did but covered their tracks really well?
That's a nature vs nurture argument

We know some things are inherent in genes and we know some things aren't. Where morality and justice fall I don't know.

I personally believe that no one is born looking to cause harm to others. That it's a trait that only comes from upbringing and society, but I suppose I could be wrong.
> Some people calmly and rationally enjoy causing others pain. And why not? What in all the natural law of the universe says they shouldn't? Only man and his tomfool idea that there's something called morality and justice.

They may feel calm and "rational", in the context, while doing it, but that doesn't mean they aren't sick. They've let the sickness take over, and it somehow went unnoticed by the society around them.

For the sake of the argument, let's look at high-crime areas in the US, and specifically black areas. Are black people more violent than white people? They must be, right? Since there is so much violent crime in areas they live, and they are completely overrepresented in violent crime cases. But, the truth is actually that, we like to pretend that we all have complete free will, and everything we do is completely up to us, and so someone who commits a crime must have *chosen* to do so. I would never kill someone, so why would that guy? He must be evil and must be burned at the stake!

Looking at the poor black neighborhoods again, the truth is that black people aren't more violent than white, but the society they're born into breeds killers and deviant behavior. If you are born in a high crime area, you are STATISTICALLY more likely to commit a crime and end up going to jail, yourself. This shows that society is the main factor in enabling criminal behavior. Of course, people who grow up with great lives can also do horrible things, but this is where research and a focus on mental health comes in. Because people don't CHOOSE out of free will to be evil; it's a sickness that brainwashes them.

This is also proven by rehabilitation; if you believe rehabilitation works on any level, then you must believe that a person who commits a crime, especially a severe one, is sick. At the time they commit the crime, they are sick, and at the risk of doing it again, or worse. But through rehabilitation, you can change the person to see that what they did was wrong, and make them remorseful. This is guidance they could have gotten BEFORE they got to the point of committing the crime.
But executing dangerous offenders isn't going to solve the issue. By the time someone is caught, they've already committed their heinous crimes. They're approaching it completely wrong. How is this going to stop tomorrow's criminal? It won't.
And you think you have the answer to solve tomorrow's criminal? Gimme a break
So what?  Too many fucking humans.  Death penalty for all rapists and murderers.  I'll pull the switch and sleep very well at night.
Are you going to pull the switch on yourself eventually then?
What do you mean they want to be? Do you think they woke up one day and decided they were going to start raping people and ruining lives? You don't think that was a process that grew over time, and stemmed from an original sickness?
No. There are people in the world who have no empathy, genuinely NO empathy. They give zero fucks about anyone else, and if it so happens that they get a kick out of fucking children, they will do it as long as nothing is there to stop them or punish them.

I'm a 3rd generation Chinese whose grandparents fled the communist army to Southeast Asia. My parents took me on holiday every year to China for two to three weeks, visiting different provinces each time, and I can tell you from my experience that jsut about 95% of the people there have that mindset of zero empathy. It stems from the famines and societal upheaval during the Cultural Revolution, where it really was, every man for himself. Young schoolkids were encouraged and rewarded for reporting people with anti-communist sentiment. If they reported their own parents, said parents would be tortured and killed - and the child rewarded.

EDIT:I would like to add that I was speaking in a sweeping generalization and it does not apply to every single person from Mainland China. Also, the societies from Taiwanese Chinese and other diaspora who escaped communism, do not generally have that mindset. Theirs are the true 1000 year old Chinese culture.
> There are people in the world who have no empathy, genuinely NO empathy.

Doesn't that sound like a sickness to you? They certainly don't sound mentally healthy.
What can we do? It's uncurable so if we let them out they'd just be dangerous to society. You can't teach a psychopath to be human, you can only teach them to act like a human. Once the cameras are off and there're no witness, they become a threat. Lock them up permanently? Maybe we could let them choose, death or permanent incarceration. If I was faced with the decision, I'd rather be dead, but I'd be too chicken to do it myself. Maybe gimme a morphine overdose or something so I can go out peacefully.
Some people aren't human.
can't tell if /r/NotKenM material or if you're actually serious
I never said most, I said many.

Many of the perpetrators were themselves victims.

I never said most of the victims or even many go on to be perpetrators.

When I said the children themselves were given a death sentence at the point of their ordeal, I didn't mean all of them go on to rape and then get sentenced to death. I was talking cumulatively, they could go down that path or they could have a life of broken and abusive relationships or they could have PTSD and never form any close bonds. Their life is forever changed from the period of their abuse.

This is because there isn't enough recognition of the crime especially in India, so thus a lack of support services.
This is quite true actually. Another rape of 17 year old girl from Unnao was perpetrated by a member of the ruling party, BJP. It was only after she tried to commit suicide and when her father was found dead in prison, killed by the cops who were supposed to be investigating the rape, did the story make it into the limelight. The BJP government while on one side making these legislation, on the other side is protecting rapists and sexual offenders who are in their party. 

Edit: here a news article about it. http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/unnao-rape-case-arrest-mla-kuldeep-singh-sengar-allahabad-hc-directs-cbi/article23526523.ece
This. It seems to me that taking rape allegations seriously and actually *investigating them and prosecuting the rapists* would do more good than suddenly declaring the rape of a child under 12 a capital offense. 
That makes sens,thanks for explaining!
Oh, so it's exactly how I thought it was. But I'd say it's working. Why do you think otherwise?
Because Reddit still sorts the comments by votes, so your brain knows that the ones at the top are "good" and the bottom are "bottom". 

Contest mode is the only thing that removes this, but that can only be turned on/off per thread, whereas this works per comment.
Damn it, now I know what's top voted because of you. I guess I should blame my own curiosity. My brain didn't know squat!
Sorry!

If it helps, I sometimes manually change the sorting to "old" and just read them chronologically.
I'll try that too, then. It's like when an anime season starts, and I just watch the first episode of everything without any external opinions. I always wanted such a system in communities like reddit as well.
Huh, can't believe I didn't know that lol.

And then sodomy laws were removed from the books, because the geometry of sexual contact is not really the issue.
Sodomy is still a crime in India. The Supreme Court abolished the law in 2009 but reinstated it in 2013. So homosexuality is officially illegal there (including female homosexuality, since the Constitution of India defines sodomy as any "unnatural sex act").
Yes. Even in the Srilankan penal code, the definition of rape involves only women. 
Sure it's well-founded, but it's not the point at hand.
I thought the point at hand is rape for children under 12. Which normally includes boys, as boys are children that can be raped..
The point at hand in that excerpt, was the girls.
Even if that were true a law like this could end up encouraging similar crimes against boys **if** the punishment only applied in the cases regarding girls.
But that's not the case? Gender doesn't affect the punishment (and why would it ever?). Read the text passage, or the article, or anything else really. Or just use common sense
Can’t deny there is a hive mentality issue in reddit though 
Not really. One day you'll get the majority calling for death to all violent criminals then a couple posts down you'll see a majority believing that the death penalty is never correct. Of course crowds will form consensus on a topic but that's what happens when you get any group together so reddit isn't really special in this respect. And even when you have large groups siding together there's always small groups of dissenters positing their own views. 
When I first came across threads it seemed like it was always Reddit being against the death penalty. But overtime I've noticed it differs. Sometimes the most upvoted comments are pro-death penalty and sometimes the most upvoted comments are against death penalty.  
  
Same thing with various other topics.  
  
I guess it just depends on whoever's online at the time the thread/comments is/are posted.
Right but the hivemind, the collective masses, ultimately determines what gets upvoted.

I as an individual, could say "Death penalty is OK" but unless most people viewing the thread agree, it will be dowvoted and ignored.

You're wrong. It's literally just you and me.

And Steve.

But we don't talk about Steve.
Prevention(through therapy, etc) and rehabilitation. Those are the only answers when it comes to reducing crime. Everything else is just vengeance porn.
Nothing, honestly. 

People who do these sorts of things (rape, murder) are beyond rehabilitation. And for those who struggle with those urges to do these things who are not beyond rehabilitation, the possibility of execution should deter them. If it doesn’t, then they were destined to destroy the lives of innocent people, and should be executed.

You cannot destroy all evil in the world, it is a part of human nature. The question should be ‘What can we do to reduce evil?,’ and you can reduce evil by enforcing these types of punishments. In my opinion, anyway.
Thanks for your reply. I'll have to disagree with you.

While there is no silver bullet to preventing these heinous acts from committing, there ARE actions that a people/govt can take to at least reduce these tendencies.

You state that somebody who would commit these acts is beyond rehabilitation, because death should be a big enough deterrent. The problem, though, is the the lives of many people who commit these crimes are as good as 'gone' anyway.

Let me give your an example: most reported sexual assaults happen in the North - states such as Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and Bihar. These states are also some of the poorest, least educated, least economically viable, least 'democratic' (by this I mean the state legislatures and ministries are infamous for nepotism), have some of the worst public healthcare, and the largest power imbalance between men and women and in gender roles. Do these factors CAUSE the assaults? No. But there is a terrific correlation.

I am not remotely justifying the behaviour - it's reprehensible and should be punished. But there are ways to address these issues than to just hang people. 

Remember, we're talking about a nation where the polity is A LOT more vocal than in some of the other great 'democracies.' Can you imagine the national outrage if an innocent was hanged? Where do we draw the line for what is deemed to be bad enough for capital punishment? Will we eventually hack off hands for theft, or cast stones for adultery? 

A society cannot be part of the liking. As Mahatma Gandhi put it, "An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."
Exactly , this acts as an deterrent for an potential rapist. The fact there is huge social and economic implication for a rapist if found guilty acts as a deterrent. However some law oin the four confines of a constitution   is not gonna act as a deterrent for a potential rapist. 
That's why background check is illegal here in France.
Exactly...any cold blooded murderers or rapists who are found guilty in a court of law should be put to death the same day.   They don’t deserve anything but a bullet in the brain.
Of course, because the court of law is infallible and once the case is closed no new evidence can be uncovered to warrant a retrial.

Good luck killing the right people with that approach.
I'm not American. They have really inconsistent age limits for things.
I agree on your latter point, but in regard to ages being arbitrary, well it can't be better to partially-draft people according to an equation like %timeInMilitaryIfDrafted = max(0, min(100, 10 x (age - 20))) ...
from what I recallcal (and take this with a grain of salt) the legal Federal drinking age is 18 however it's up to the state to decide to keep it 18 or make it 21. If it's 18 they lose like 10% of the funding. I'm still drunk/high from the Holiday so please don't lambasted me for no link. 
States are also allowed to carve out exceptions, with the majority of states saying that teenagers can be given drinks by their parents and/or consume alcohol in their home (as with most state-level laws, these are pretty patchwork, so it's worth knowing what the ones for your state are).
Also 12 is often the age when children graduate from primary school and enter secondary school. 
I think India is become more westernized I would not be surprised if the rape rate is calling as men become more used to the presence of women. In Pakistan we have a relatively low rape rate but that's because of extreme sexual segregation. 
Could you cite your claim that Pakistan has a lower rate? According to this Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics ) , Pakistan has a higher per 100000 case of assault, which according to me is the more m correct way of comparing 2 countries. Sexual assault is a problem world over, and every country should deal with this issue.
We both have less then most western countries on  that list. India also has a higher population so that can put per capita stats out of wack. India has areas where rape is very common and others where it's very rare. 
You mean you have a low report rate on rape. I highly doubt that Pakistan doesn't have a rape problem.
We have a low report rate and when it does happen it usually results in murder or torture due to sexual repression. But the actual rate, even unreported, is low because there is simply not that much contact between the sexes. 
you don't know the unreported rate, that's why it's unreported. in segregated societies it tends to be high
Fair enough but I simply don't see how it could be done in most circumstances

Seems like it's pretty bad for women in both countries.

 Pakistan is shit for everyone lol. I already know that. India isn't better at all. Bangladesh is making some strides though.
Read up on rarefaction


I wouldn't call that being "Westernised". It's more like, going towards where we should be, normalisation. 

And I totally agree with you about that. What might happen some time down the road, is certain places, especially the rural areas, might return to the same.
Indeed, there are Eastern cultures where appropriate resources are relegated to deal with violence against women and children, although every country could do better. South Asian culture needs some work.
It's westernization. Because the norm in India is the situation now. 
No it is not. These brutal rapes are occuring more and more frequently just now. They're not the norm.
>In Pakistan we have a relatively low rape rate

The figures for Pakistan aren't really any more reliable than the figures from India. Women in both nations are very hesitant to report their victimization, and the victimization of children is almost never reported unless it results in death or visible disfigurement.

Pakistan has, numerically, a comparable track record in other areas related to the health and well being of women (like maternal mortality) so I would expect it to be at least as bad there, just relatively unreported as is typical across South Asia. The public resources to accommodate rape victims are just not allocated, and they are discouraged at every turn from even reporting their victimization.
Pakistan is like a mecca of rape according to any source I look at. What the fuck are you talking about?
what source is that?

Girls are treated as property. They're somebody's "responsibility" - father or husband's.  The dowry culture plus the fact that men *believe* women to be dumb is part of the problem. The other issue is the conservative atmosphere. If having sex was seen as a natural thing (or something not just limited to after marriage) these things wouldn't happen. 

India has a long way to go. 100% literacy rate is the first step. But honestly I don't think things are going to change even by the time I'm old.

Also, just a few years before Polanski raped Geimer, his wife was famously and gruesomely murdered by the so-called Manson Family. Not saying that exhonerates him, but it might provide some sort of backdrop for his actions and mental-state.

People who are involved in that kind of relationship aren't always the best judges of that relationship. I'm not saying that's necessarily the case here, simply because I haven't really done that much research into it, but it's not unusual for someone to normalize something that's done to them.

I don't see how turning it upside down makes anything better. 
I feel like it just made things a lot worse.
I gotta admit I was expecting ):
Why the fuck would the realities and equipment for investigating the sexual abuse of kids make me want to do anything but cry and/or throat punch someone?  
Hey on the bright side that just means that there are a ton of people out there devoted to catching the people responsible. So much so that they have tools and machines specifically created/invented for the sole purpose of helping children get the justice they deserve. I know I'd be proud as hell if it were my job (if I could ever stomach that work).
If you kill your victim during the intercourse and then finish, is that necrophilia? 
It's sort of like, whether adding the death penalty would dissuade more prospective rapists or increase the number of rapists who will actively murder their victims, and which amount would be more. 

The issue for me is I don't know any statistic which proves the point either way, so to me this is again more ah, that thing, whatya call it,  can't remember the word, it's the thing where you do something nice and make sure everyone knows it's you who did it. It's basically that. 

The real solution and discussion for me would be how do we decrease the number of rapes using points of research with a strong likelihood of succeeding, is it a problem inherent to the current culture, would sex ed help long term, how do we make our executive more effective, how do we dissuade future rapists in an effective manner, do we set up a committee to see how effective( affective?) the law would be?
I mean, that logic makes total sense. "No witnesses" has been a meme for as long as I can remember.
I don't think it's ridiculous because to be honest I don't know what works, what I feel is important is to have a framework for laws where we can explain via researched facts that this would probably work, or at the very least set up committees to check how effective( affective?) the law was after it has been passed.

Again, none of us know the actual mind of the rapist, so to me could be either way. I just would like our solution to be wider than death penalty! I bet that fixes it!
Not if their body is absolutely desecrated. And that's what i think OP is getting at. Before where some scumfuck would only rape, this might encourage them to rape, murder and destroy the body.
Not if you toss the body into some water for a bit. Can't determine if there are vaginal tears if her genitals have all rotted.
Yes but if they are getting executed either way it's more likely they will 'double down' and attempt to hide the evidence via getting rid of the witness.

You can mutilate the corpse in ways that destroys any evidence of rape.
Yeah but if they go all the way and burn the body? Bury it somewhere nobody can find it etc? There IS problems with this if death penalty isn't given for the murder too. 
Not if the murder is gruesome enough. The question for the criminal then becomes, "Do I allow this walking talking piece of evidence to leave and get me the death penalty, or do I try to totally and utterly destroy the evidence so that I hopefully won't get caught, or at most get life in prison with there being no way to test for rape?"
> It's very easy to test if rape happened before the murder,

It is, I agree. But that does assume the killer hasn't done something to destroy evidence of rape. I'm sorry, it's a gross thing to think about.
A rational person like you would think that way.

A random raper might not have that thought process, and belive that by killing the victim he could have a chance of avoiding the rape acusations. Remember this might not be the smartests guy, and most likely is someone very impulsive.
Only if you find the bodies.
Not if they burned the body.
That's an interesting point that I've not heard before.

I personally have no moral qualms with the death penalty because some people do not deserve their life due to the actions they've conducted. This is obvious to most people in the form of animal attacks: when, say, a dog gets out of its fence and aggressively harms a child, many people are OK with the animal being put down for the safety of everyone else.

To be clear, though, I am against actually administering the death penalty due to
1) innocent people being executed (it should never happen, not-a-once) and
2) there is too much disparity in how the punishment is allocated (blacks in the US are far more likely to be executed than whites for less violent crimes)

But I could imagine that I personally would feel bad if I were in charge of administering the punishment in some way. I would feel worse the closer to the deed. So, for example, I would feel bad if I had veto power but didn't use it. I would feel worse if I were on the jury and voted "yay" to execution. And I would feel worse still if I were in charge of pressing the button.

But I had never once considered the possibility that these negative feelings could bleed upwards, so to say. The idea that there could be some "base level" feeling of negativity running through out society due to this act being conducted and interpreted as acceptable.

Actually, now that I'm typing this, I have had an illuminating experience several years back. I had an Israeli friend that had lived in the US for several years. I asked him how he liked it here. He said that he loved it here  but he had one complaint: everyone is always watching out for everyone else, waiting to see what they're doing wrong.

And he meant this down to the menial level. People are always looking in on other people's business to see whatever sort of transgressions they might be doing, whether it legal or social or whatever. And, lo and behold, the US has more people in jail than any other country in the world. Seems strange now that I think about it but I wonder how much the two phenomena interact with each other.

Obviously causation is not the same as correlation. But it still sucks nonetheless, whether it's a cause or a symptom. It makes me feel less free, in a sense. Huh.

Sorry for the ramble. Thanks for reading.
> And what of those who are later found to be innocent after they were executed?

Is there a moral difference between a person dying in prison as a result of execution versus a person dying in prison as a result of natural causes? 

Both a sentence of death and a sentence of life in prison end the same way: the person dies after spending a period of time in prison. Since you cannot predict when someone will die, you cannot even rely on the argument that "we have time to fix it" with a life sentence - it's not clear that you have any more time one way or the other when comparing life vs. death penalty. 
If there is no moral difference between life in prison and the death penalty, then why would the death penalty exist? I don’t agree with you, but by your view you’re making an argument against using the death penalty. Might as well just save money for the government (because executing someone is more expensive) and use life imprisonment instead, right?
Perhaps, but I think you can also make a reasonable case that the life sentence is morally worse because you have implicitly concluded death is required, but are too cowardly to actually implement the courage of your convictions. 
They also don't think they will be caught. 
Couldn't it be the case that that's because there's a population of would-be criminals who are more rational and don't do the crimes because of the deterrents? The population of extreme criminals that remains does the crimes because of the fact that they are not motivated by rational thought. 
Exactly. A good example is murder. Usually when somebody murders someone in a fit of rage, all logic goes out the window and they act out of pure anger. It's only after they murdered the other person when they realize, "Oh shit. I'm going to jail for life."
Actually criminologists say certainty not severity better reduces crime.  Certainty of being caught vs severity of punishment that nearly all criminals think they have a low chance of facing.
Its not about being caught. Its about being charged. Witnesses disappear, victims get blackballed the rich target the poor. 
Death penalties does nothing to detterent crimes. It is just a tool of revenge
What tactics are normally used to get away with it? Is there evidence that goes unreported or just weaselly fiends striking when evidence is least likely? I would say a reward for evidence of a crime would be good if it wouldn't get abused somehow...anywhere.

Edit: Hell, there are rape kits just piling up, waiting to be processed in the US.
Just in general, law enforcement is much worse at catching criminals than you see on TV. Not because they suck at their jobs necessarily. It’s just really fucking hard to catch people, and most of the people who do get caught committing crimes are caught because they were stupid. Most of the rest, police just got lucky somehow.

The flip side is that it is also very hard to *guarantee* you won’t get caught, and generally the fact that that risk exists is enough to deter most reasonable people that aren’t deterred by just not wanting to commit the crime in the first place.

It’s like the saying that most locks are there to keep normal people honest and not because they’d present much of an obstacle to someone who was really dedicated to getting through them.
Vanishingly as in this is a new phenomenon??
That fact that the vast majority of people who do these things aren't rational might speak to the fact that deterrence works, since the more rational ones are being scared away from committing these crimes.

You can't really track people who really want to rape a kid but choose not to because they don't want to go to jail.  However, you can track child marriages in places that allow kids this young to be married, and those numbers aren't small.

Doesn't this mean that they won't figure out that they’re better off killing a child after molestation rather than leaving them alive?
Interesting way to look at it, makes sense when you think about it.
Not true

Quite true and sometimes it can be a very close member of the family, maybe even one of the parents or siblings. I think if it could be determined that there is scope for redemption then we should help people like that, although sometimes the nature of crime makes it tough for us to grant such mercy.

Hopefully there is some way to understand all this better and help those who still could be saved.
no link, but i read it was staggeringly high in india.. like you have a 70% chance of having been raped, and most of those were in early childhood (and most of those were by fam)

[edit: NO LINK IM SRY JEEZ i think it was a recent poll of only around 2k ppl, im not authoritative source of rape and molestation data in faraway lands. cut me some slack. rape CERTAINLY happens more than it should.. can we stop bickering about the degree?]

Not just by family.  I was routinely abused from the age of 5-10 in India while in boarding school by local people (and a local missionary).  
Is it really only aimed at kids or was it a coincidence that it stopped when u were 10?
It stopped at 10 because we left India.

Wipe the slate clean and start over?
Well that's exactly why you remove him or her from society by putting them into prison.
...or a woman
Bleeding hearts will never concede that a proven offender should be removed from society by means of death, unfortunately the death penalty carries highly inflated legal costs which allow the argument that death penalty ends up costing more than life in prison which is a travesty. Either the offender needs to contribute to society by the only means possible by supervised labor or be removed from society. It’s the part where there is lack of evidence that makes this whole discussion polar 
The same people who don't trust the government to deal with pot-holes in the road, think the government can decide who should live and die just fine.
Except you are sentenced by a jury of your peers, not the government. Besides, in most rape cases DNA of the perpetrator is readily available if you seek out help within a few days. 
DNA evidence is honestly kinda shit
Jury of my peers is your argument? Most people are bloody idiots. A random selection of people deciding if a person dies or not doesn't make it any better.
"Bleeding hearts'; Why does every argument these days involve breaking down the opposite party in a personal way? It's a non-argument.

Death is permanent, in case mistakes were made. Also, death is the easy way out.
To be frank, it’s a tribal mentality, eye for an eye if you will. I should not have prefaced my argument with bleeding hearts because you began yours with critiquing my choice of term. To say it’s a non argument is to say because of an poor introduction the following is therefore baseless when in fact that is not the case, I do agree with you however that because death is permanent it should only be applied in cases where there is proof beyond reasonable doubt & the pepatrator shows no signs of remorse or wrongdoing & does not comply with efforts of rehabilitation. Tell me this though, if an innocent person, say a child - 12yrs old in this instance is raped and the offender is found and charged beyond reasonable doubt would you want that person walking the street again? I’m simply saying that because of inflated legal costs the implication of lack of evidence disallows the potential of a death penalty. There cannot be a death penalty (and nor should there be in this day and age) but perhaps you need to ask yourself, as a person, a member of society and the public, when is someone a lost cause?
But isn't that what life imprisonment is for? Then that individual is sequestered from society and will never have the opportunity to reoffend (which is absolutely essential, even to "bleeding hearts" \*eyeroll* like me). And it costs LESS to feed and house them than it does for the legal process for a death penalty case. And finally, IF that individual did happen to be innocent, and new evidence was discovered to clear their name, shouldn't that person have that opportunity? (But even if they are 100% clearly guilty proven far beyond a shadow of a doubt, reasons 1 and 2 still stand). 


Poor argument referred to "bleeding hearts" alone, not the rest of the comment, which made sense.

The problem here is that there is no such thing as 'beyond doubt'. And having someone killed over the 'reasonable' aspect seems wrong to me. You can't take back murder. The murderer couldn't and the ones punishing him can't.

On the lost cause-argument, if he is deemed as such, lock him up forever. He can't be a functional human again, but he still has to pay for what he did. Life in prison seems fitting for that. Like you said, the cheaper option, the safer option for mistakes made, the more punishing option (not that punishment should be the *first* concern).
>The problem here is that there is no such thing as 'beyond doubt'.


The real problem here is people against the death penalty make up lies like this one and spread it as a fact. There is absolutely cases of people found guilty beyond any and all doubts.
[First of all, calm the hell down.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8duloh/death_for_rape_of_children_below_12_says_indian/dxqavy6/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=worldnews)

Find them covered in blood, knife in hand, fine that seems pretty clear. But to shape a justice system after those 0.0001% of cases is ridiculous.

Get death penalty gone and the alternative is just as good, better even on many fronts (see previous), and you don't have to debate what constitutes 'reasonable doubt' on a case-per-case interpretative basis, which would likely loosen the concept over time once more. Be like most of the first world and get rid of the petty revenge and put in actual rehab and/or punishment instead.
>Find them covered in blood, knife in hand, fine that seems pretty clear. But to shape a justice system after those 0.0001% of cases is ridiculous.

No, just use the death penalty in those 0.0001% of cases without allowing 25 appeals that make it so expensive. 

>Be like most of the first world 


America is the first world. Why doesn't your country do the same?

People are falsely convicted "beyond reasonable doubt" *all the time*.  At its core, this is the fundamental problem here.  Rape cases are notoriously hard to prove, too, making this even more difficult.
The death penalty costs so much because we better be damn sure the person is 100% proven guilty before we all decide to contribute to killing him or her. 

If we're not sure, or if, like we've seen happen *many* times, the person ends up being innocent of the crime, then we all need to fess up to the fact that we have at least a small part in committing murder by supporting the state's action to execute someone who didn't "deserve" it. 

Hopefully you'll never have to face being wrongly accused for a crime or wrong-doing, but if you are, you'll be damned thankful that the legal system has so many failsafes to catch the incorrect accusation before punishment that cannot be reversed is applied. 

Are you okay with killing one innocent person in the name of killing 10 guilty people? Is that one person's life worth your vision of justice? 

What about flipped the other way. Is it worth killing 10 innocent people to remove 1 "proven offender" from society? 
I know I won't concede to it since

* It's not a deterrent
* It's more expensive than life w/o parole (in the US)
* The margin of error (i.e. killing an innocent person) is too high

If you want to talk about offenders "contributing to society" try starting at the prison system's erection for punishment/revenge instead of rehabilitation.
You don't have to be a "bleeding heart" to not want the state killing people. Pretty much every western developed country in the world has decided not to allow it, those who support it are stuck in the past. 
Yup.  I don't have the paranoia of government so many have, but I still feel granting a group of people the ability to decide who lives and dies to be fraught with peril.

People are falsely convicted of things all the time.  As soon as you murder someone who isnt guilty... Well, what then?  How many innocent deaths are acceptable?  Who decides THAT?
America is literally the only first world western country still murdering it's own people in the name of justice. But America seems to like the title of only first world country doing barbaric shit.
I don’t think you read my second comment
Ok let's set aside the financial argument against the death penalty. Show me a single country that has the death penalty that hasn't executed an innocent person by mistake. Any system of justice that has innocent people being literally murdered by the government by mistake is not a just society.
That's a really good question with a very long and complicated answer!

Obviously I can't state the specifics of that case, because I don't know it, but I can help shed some insight on some reasons.

Firstly, and this is very important to know this kind of **abuse frequently spawns altered memories** it's part of why abuse recipients are terrible witnesses. Their trauma generally causes their brain to add additional detail in an attempt to rationalize what was going on in some twisted, acceptable manner.

In my case, for instance, my abuse led to me completely removing myself from my family. I left home, by my own volition, and it was YEARS before I had any interaction with my family. Because my abuse was familial in nature, my brain had considered my entire family as equally untrustworthy. I still have difficulty knowing if some of what I recall is accurate or not, as I'm fairly certain logically my mother knew nothing about it. (it wasn't...insidious in my instance as it is frequently with familial issues)

I am only NOW 20 years later, starting to get in touch with my family, people I loved for my entire childhood. This is after years of therapy.

---

As for the family knowing - As I said, I don't know the circumstances. I don't know the ages, the parts of the world, if religion was involved, what religion.

If the others would watch, that likely means they were also abuse recipients in some way. I'm making a massive generalization here, but that seems the most likely scenario, and the one I've certainly heard about the most.

There are many complicated circumstances where this could occur - most of them pretty horrific in nature. The most benign of which is religion based or location based (some regions of the world find this behaviour far more tolerable than others). With religion it's not generally that the religion endorses it, but that the religion endorses remaining completely silent about such abuses. "Oh he's just sinning, he'll stop eventually".

These things are pretty sickening, and even more sickening to listen to interviews of (edit: the mental gymnastics some religious folks do to convince themselves that their behavior during the abuses as a third party was fine and righteous)
Thanks.

It's a tough read for anyone, and I tried to keep things as vague as I could while still providing as much value as I could.

Thank you for being brave and reading it!

If you read the timestamp of the private message, it was LONG before you apologised.

Both our behaviour sucked royally. You made me relive my trauma, very vividly, and as a response I lashed out - probably similar to yourself.

This is the damage abuse causes. Even years and years and years after the fact. And I'm apparently a 'well adjusted' case.

EDIT: For those who read this afterwards - take a look at our history over the last hour. This is the kind of behavior that abuse like this triggers, in people who are trying their best to not let the damage impact them. It **never** goes away.
There absolutely is. Pioneering studies are being done constantly in this field because of the impact it has on children.

Unfortunately, pedophilia is a useful political tool sometimes, so many of the larger democracies keep draconic laws in place which prevent these people from even entering rehabilitation of any kind.

Rehab for offenders depends on reason for offending, and frequency of offending. There are many other variables involved, but from what I've studied those two seem to be the major contributing factors.

Rehab is incredibly difficult for child abusers who were groomed into child abuse themselves though... that's the most sympathetic of causes, and also the most complex.
Supposedly yes. I was reading on two X that there is something like a 70% rehab rate. 
There is something like this going on in the UK too. I've seen adverts for it on Facebook and I kinda felt sad looking through the FB comments to see a load of lads tagging their mates as if it's just a big joke.
> They treat the sickness before a crime is committed, and give access to therapy without jeopardising your entire future.

Treatment is of course difficult for a variety of reasons. It's basically just suppression and control at this point. Since research is limited as too few non-offender pedophiles have stepped forward in the past. Hopefully programs like the Dunkelfeld project can help to further science in that regard. 

But even then is any(thing that looks like an) attempt at "curing" peoples sexuality a touchy subject because people with other more or less socially accepted but consentual sexualities could feel threatened or insulted by it. 

> I don't think this approach will stop the amoral child molesters who may even enjoy causing harm.

But it might be interesting to explore why non-psychopatic pedophiles disproportionately often become mass offenders. 
In India? Years of expensive therapy and care? Really?
However the Indian health care system is not even close to the German one. India also has like infinite population which makes it even more difficult to cover everybody. 
Then a 2 fold. Death sentence to these sick fucks. But therapy before they do anything.
A 6 month old baby was raped and killed yesterday. Last week a 12 year old was also raped and killed. Allegedly by a politician. And I think in February(?) Another infant suffered the same fate. And Im about 8000% sure there have been many little girls who the same thing has happened to in the years gone by.


Honestly, I don't know if therapy could help someone who is prepared to do something as fucked up as this. As my mom used to say; you can take a horse to the water, you cant force it to drink.


If killing them off means one fewer fuckhead is going to stick their dick into a kid, sign me up. 


Putting them in prison does exactly the same thing, except that if they actually turn out to be innocent you can let them go. You can't unexecute someone.
That whole situation is so fucking disgusting. But there are a lot of protests happening (I was a part of one), I'm not saying that things are fixed but at least the people are calling out this absolute vile shit. 
Not necessarily. By pointing out that murders lead to more likely convictions, it's a potential offset to the incentive to kill the victim. Ie. Deterrent effect is potentially increased overall, which is good for children too.
Context is everything. If you go back and read the comment he replied to, I think the point of view makes more sense. No one here is recommending you murder your rape victims.
I think that they're saying that it's very easy to be convicted for murder so they wouldn't murder the child to begin with. 
Wow, you really have to bend over backwards to project that issue onto their comment.

They’re pretty clearly just politely offering a counter argument to the root comment which pointed out a potential negative effect of this policy.

 Not everybody has to scream “won’t somebody think of the children” while discussing policy to make sure everybody knows they actually care. The guy couldn’t have been less emotional or “justice bonery”.
Reddit has a huge hard-on for violent "justice". 
Yeah it has a weird vibe
What I said is relevant, in my opinion, because it's possible for the perpetrator to hide the rape by killing the victim and then destroying the evidence of the initial crime.

And if the range of sentencing is less harsh for the murder than the rape it is in their interest to do so.
That's a ridiculous false equivalence. We're talking about the fact this system will incentivise murdering child rape victims. "Let's murder that guy so he can't tell anyone we stole from him".
> not as solid as the judge thought

aka literally fabricated by corrupt police.
yea you have a point there. sigh. Just saw a vid where they used some computer program to superimpose expressions onto someone else's face on video. Creepy shit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk
This sounds a lot like Jeffrey Epstein in the United States. He's a billionaire pedophile that our government is protecting. 
Same is worryingly true in many countries.
This.  If we experimented with rehab or preventative therapy, even if it was shown to drastically reduce the likelihood someone would go on to rape, it would largely be ignored just because it's not tough on child rapists.
you could make the same statement about any country. just in europe the [age of consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe) varies quite a bit and that's a relatively homogeneous area in terms of cultural differences. 
The 21 thing was an attempt to curb drunk driving.  Even today America has more cars than most other developed countries, so this pressure to raise the drinking age is somewhat unique.

>Dude is still getting awards at the Oscars

No, he is not. Hasn't won an award since 2003. I know what you are trying to say, but let's get it right at least.
Not only is he still receiving awards but a significant portion of Hollywood hand waves his actions away as well. It's disgusting. 
Yep, Harrison Ford went and dropped one off with him back in '03 :(
Maybe they keep awarding them in the hope that he’ll forget, fly over to receive it, and get arrested. 
The same actors that are preaching “Me Too” are the ones who openly support child molesting Polanski 
Why wouldn't he ? Don't get me wrong, he is a piece of trash human being but Oscars are not here to celebrate what kind of humans people are
Because he's a liberal

[deleted]
I'm sure you know that politicians, religious leaders and captains of industry in America all have the same disgusting history when it comes to child rape. Pretending  otherwise shows a hidden agenda on your part. Hollywood is the scapegoat all these others point at as hedonistic when they enjoy the same perversions. 
Hollywood jews love that sick fuck; they clap and everything.
yea I think it was pretty normal for adults to fuck girls in their mid teens back then. I always use to think when rockstars talked about "Daddy's little girl". They were talking about the past when they were 16 or 17 cool guy with the motorcycle getting a girl of similar age that. Not something that happened last week.


That said I think that she was lying about some of the events. I think they locked her in the house to get her off heroin while she was preg. I doubt that Tyler sent some one to kill her by burning the house down, I bet she started the fire to get free. And I doubt that Tyler was in the operation room doing cocaine during the abortion.

But Tyler is still an asshole.
Yeah bruh I went to Coldharbour willingly. 

Violate me daddy Molag.

Of course a solution doesn't lie with the sentencing, but the root causes of the behavior as you say.  

I was just supporting the comment that seemed to first clarify that particular possible outcome of the new sentencing *could* be, since others seemed to not be seeing it that way.
If you are talking about mutilation of the body, I think the judges in India will consider those violent acts while making their sentence. From what I understand the decisions taken by judiciary in India are subjective. Many times they will depend upon the circumstances under which the crime was committed and the nature of behavior of the accused. Usually the judges will refer terms like 'rarest of the rare' for crimes of such high degree. The angle that you are saying where someone can commit rape, then murder them and afterwards destroy the body will come under intense scrutiny of the judges and will guarantee  a capital punishment. The problem in India  is that the police and the prosecution who have made the case should be able to prove without a doubt that the crime was committed and the parties who were arrested for the crime were the ones who actually did it.
I guess in the event they destrpy the body, they'd be given the death penalty under the special circumstance for murder.
if you give em the old walter white milkshake there's probably not gonna be anything left to do an autopsy on.
That can already happen though. If u are able to do that and want to take that risk, you can get away with anything today. 
It's not particularly clear to me why the life in prision sentence makes any difference. It is the same, just one more step removed. Instead of hiring an executioner, we pussy out and get the grim reaper to do our dirty work. I am not sure why that should make us feel any better. In fact, it seems morally cowardly. If we are going to sentence a person to die, let's at least have the moral conviction to do it ourselves rather than outsourcing it to "nature".
because they might be found innocent (25% of them apparently) . anyway im my opinion we should keep them alive and get rid of the death penalty. i believe life in prison is just meant to keep them separated from society because we deem them to dangerous. we could make their life healthy and not horrible. maybe some monitored internet access, more phone time maybe some extra stuff like cigarettes. 
It is the same problem in the case of life in prison. There is a chance the person is in fact innocent. There is a chance they will die in prison before the truth is exposed.


There’s also a chance they’ll be released and get to live out the rest of their lives as free people. Seems to me we have an obligation to let that scenario play out even if it’s a small chance. 

[This study](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/death-penalty-study-4-percent-defendants-innocent) says 4%, but that’s obviously a difficult thing to measure. 
That is true in the death penalty case and the life in prison case. Either way, there is a chance they will get out before death occurs. So I don't see the difference. 
Dude this is an odd viewpoint. You're basically saying being in prison is bad enough that we might as well kill someone if they'll be in prison for life, despite the innocent people. You don't think those innocent people would disagree after getting out?? 
Perhaps I didn't express myself properly, so I will try again.

Consider a person who is actually innocent, but was convicted anyway.

If they were sentenced to death, there is a chance their innocence will be discovered first, and there is a chance they will die first. 

If they were sentenced to life, there is a chance their innocence will be discovered, and there chance they will die first.

My argument is that if it bothers you the innocent person is dying, it is not relevant whether a human being or the grim reaper is the agent. Death is the designed end goal of both sentences, and I can't see the difference from a moral perspective who is the agent that acts on our behalf so that death occurs. 
We have 1 life on earth, and I'd sure as fuck rather 40-80 years of chances to be proved innocent than however long my stay in death row is. After you're executed... It's over. After a few decades in prison... You're still there!! It's clearly a preferable situation for an innocent person. You can kill yourself at any time if you really want to. 
> There is a chance the person is in fact innocent. There is a chance they will die in prison before the truth is exposed.

except its much more likely they would get found innocent while in prison than on death row.
I am not sure that is actually true. Death penalty cases tend to get a lot more attention at every step of the process. The probability of exoneration might actually be higher if sentenced to death. 
This is the key. The certainty of getting caught is vastly more powerful as a deterrent than how severe or brutal the punishment is.

From our very own Department of Justice, summarizing decades of research on this:

https://nij.gov/five-things/pages/deterrence.aspx
Thats the critical point, that a lot of politicians don't get. Most criminals don't expect to get caught, why would they be scared of the consequences? Most criminals don't think rationally, that's WHY they are criminals in the first place.
That's because the ones who do think they will be caught are either more careful or don't do it. 
They clearly already don't (Ray Moore, priests, camp leaders)
[deleted]
So, I know that in the US, the death penalty costs more to the State than life sentences. However, I've heard this is only because of the way it's implemented. So are these costs inversed in other countries? 
[deleted]
The cost isn’t the execution. It’s the lengthy and expensive appeals process meant to cut down on the number of innocent people who are executed.
He says while thinking with his feelings.
I'm so going to use that.
[deleted]
[deleted]
In the US, most of the additional costs of the death penalty comes from the higher standard of conviction for capital punishment - lawyers, judges, investigations, etc.  You could lower those costs and simultaneously raise the possibility of innocent people being executed - or you could recognize that the death penalty has no place in a civilized society because no justice system is accurate enough to lower the risk to an acceptable level.
It's not inflated, legal costs are just ridiculous in the US. 
You have no idea how much the justice system costs. You also have no conception of what prisons are like if you think that prison, especially something like say Florence ADX, is preferable to a quick death.
So instead of using expensive drugs to kill them humanely, put them in front of a firing squad. 
The drugs cost nothing. The bulk of expenses comes from legal costs, lawyers, etc.
It’s also the housing. It costs a few hundred a day when you include food, medical, and the costs of the guards who have to watch them. Then factor in the amount of time they are on death row. Which is normally 15+ years. Also if said inmate has a serious medical issue they state is required by law to give him or her medical care. 
The expense is caused by the increased charges on the state by the prosecutors and court when the death penalty is pursued and not the material cost of the execution 
thats too expensive sheesh its free to just stomp their head in.
> let's save some state money and get rid of these guys. 

If you want to save money, you should want to abolish the death penalty.  

Capital cases are more expensive than locking the person up for life, in large part because you can't undo a the death penalty of an innocent person wrongly convicted.

Why should taxpayers have to pay for your revenge fantasies?


That argument is flawed because you are suggesting that there is only 1 way to kill a criminal which requires due process and some sort of humane death.
If it was just between convicting someone to stay in prison for life, or killing them on the spot once found guilty. It'd probably be cheaper to do the latter.
No justice system in the world can possibly be accurate enough to justify the risk of killing innocents that would go along with killing the convicted "on the spot".
What if you literally saw them do it? Either way it'd still be cheaper though right?
>What if you literally saw them do it? 

What if you saw a murder, then identified the wrong person and an innocent person was executed?  

Five people said they saw Kirk Bloodsworth at the scene of a rape.  All five were wrong.  [Fortunately, Bloodsworth was freed after nine years on death row after DNA evidence cleared his name.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/)

How many innocent people should the government kill to satisfy your need to treat complex matters as if they were simple?
I don’t understand. Who is the word “you” referring to in your question?

Trials exist in part to determine the facts of a case in a public way. Because all members of the public need to have faith in rule of law being correctly executed in order for society to function. 

Witnesses lie or misremember. People are psychologically pressured into false confessions. Mistrials happen. Blackmail and bribery happen. Racism happens. The false positive error rate of death penalty cases is ridiculous and embarrassing.

Objective truth only exists in the presence of evidence that we can all observe, which is what trials and rule of law attempt to establish. 
The problem with this is that eyewitness testimony *sucks*, and in the worst cases psychiatrists, police officers and other authority figures are capable of coaching you into changing your own memory of an event without you or them realizing what's going on.  This is one of the enduring problems in western justice systems because we've known about it for decades and it's always being reconfirmed, but we've come to rely on it so much that we've never really done much about it.
>That argument is flawed because you are suggesting that there is only 1 way to kill a criminal 

That has nothing to do with my argument.  At no point did I ever even attempt to specify *how* to kill someone.  

As Richard Feynman said, "If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong...It doesn’t make any difference how beautiful your guess is, it doesn’t matter how smart you are who made the guess, or what his name is… If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. That’s all there is to it."

The death penalty has been proven to be [more expensive in state after state after state after state](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty).  

There are also dozens of cases where the person on death row was exonerated and set free, plus dozens of cases where there's evidence that the person should have been exonerated, but you can't free an executed criminal.  

The death penalty has been tried.  It disagrees with experiment.     It is wrong financially.  And, unless you can somehow make a compelling reason to kill people for crimes that they didn't commit, it is wrong morally.

That's because it's death penalty + trial. You're really telling me it's cheaper to house someone for years and feed them than kill them? You literally do it for free with tools in a house, or just simply lock them in and not feed them for a week or two. Like it could require almost no effort on your part to enact this punishment.
>That's because it's death penalty + trial.

And that's the goddamn point.  Ignoring the costs of the trial is like saying that the Atlantic Ocean is really dry once you ignore all of that pesky water.

And, even with the expenses of trials, sometimes people get a death penalty conviction for crimes they didn't commit.



[deleted]
The cost is inflated because of the lengthy appeals process.  If the appeals process isn't what it currently is more innocent people get sentenced to death. You don't know what you're talking about.
That's not the point, it's the cost of the legal system around it, not bullet vs injection.
Wow, you're not very smart.

Do you really think it's the cost of the method? It's the first of the judges, lawyers, bailiffs and other officials. Plus the cost of getting it wrong which is on the tax payers.
The expense comes from the appeals process. It takes a long time to actually execute someone because we want to make sure we're actually sentencing the right person. You do *not* want to cut corners here, because [4% of those sentenced to death are given a posthumous exoneration](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7230). The wrongful murder of even one innocent is already too much, we don't need to make it higher.

I also used to be in support of the death penalty, until I realized how bad it actually is. Among other things it...

* Costs way too much; it's far cheaper and simpler to just throw 'em in prison
* Takes too many innocent lives. Even one is too much, but an error rate of 4% is extremely high considering the circumstance.
* Disproportionately targets minorities and the poor. It's barely even justice at this point. Imagine being wrongfully convicted and not having the money/connections to properly defend yourself. At least, if you know you're innocent, you can keep trying to appeal if you get thrown in prison. A bit difficult to undo death, however.
* Doesn't even work as a deterrent. There is no credible statistical evidence that shows that the death penalty actually reduces crime.

As of right now, I don't have the time to properly source these arguments, so hopefully someone else can come along and cover for me. Or, you could, y'know, google them yourself if you have the time and want to see yourself convinced.
>The wrongful murder of even one innocent is already too much

Too much for what? Social policy really can't afford to get too hung up on idealism. Otherwise we'd just save a lot of time and money abolishing trials and prisons altogether to avoid the risk of imprisoning a single innocent person.
> Firing squad seems cheap and effective. 

And where do you find an unfiring squad when DNA evidence proves the guy you shot didn't do the crime?
Yes but prisons need them to make money off our tax dollars. 
When it comes to rape in India, they’re right.  Most estimates are that only ~5-6% of rapes in India are reported to police.  In many of those cases charges aren’t lain, and even of those charged, the conviction rate is only ~30%.

So overall, if you rape someone in India, there’s probably about a 99% chance you won’t be convicted.
Some do hideous crimes just to prove they can't be caught. I think personally the control through guilt as they do in Japan or the rehabilitation as in some Scandinavian countries works the best.
> Couldn't it be the case that that's because there's a population of would-be criminals who are more rational and don't do the crimes because of the deterrents?

Well yes but then we are talking about the difference between the wild west and modern societies enforcement of the rule of law.

When I'm talking about deterrents I'm meaning extremely harsh punishments for a crime. 

Most of all the potential "rational" criminals would be put off far before that level of punishment so increasing the level of punishment to death penalty is erroneously trying to deter those that are never going to be deterred, with the added bonus of sometimes killing someone that didn't do anything wrong.
I can't imagine a child rapist as rational. Doubly so for the gang rapes that inspired this legislation.

Obviously there are exceptions; the horror stories of pedophile rings turning child porn into some kind of networking enterprise are awful. But if these people were able to let rational fear of the consequences override their urges to commit crimes, they wouldn't be criminals.
Even extreme criminals are rational, but the factors that go into consideration when they rationalize their actions can be difficult to fathom. 
In any case, jail time seems to be enough of a deterrent, death penalty is not needed.
I'm against the death penalty for many reasons but it's foolish to say that is "does nothing to deter crimes." It's a solid deterrent. It's just not worth it.
Is it really a foolish thing to say though? If you are already so fucked in the head that you are about to commit a crime that would get you life in prison, do you think you would stop up and go "It's a good thing I will only spend the rest of my life in prison, if I could get the chair I would never murder-rape all these people"?
It's very foolish to think that all crimes are irrational. There are many people who were put to death or have life in prison who did what they did conscientiously -- drug lords and assassins for instance.

Crazed murderers as well as rapists are a little more ill and should be treated with compassion, I agree.
Yes but a druglord isn't going to quit being a druglord because they might be put to death. They wont suddenly not order a hit on a rival druglords family just because it risks them getting the death penalty. Same with an assasin, if you have killed so many people that you are already facing life in prison, are you really going to turn down a job because it might get you the chair?
Lifelong punishment and Death Penalty have the same deterrent factor. If you murder someone, you don't think about. Oh I am only going to jail for my life instead of getting grilled, lets do it then. Criminals either think "I won't be caught", "I don't care for my life anymore" or "I didn't think at all in the moment"
>Criminals either think "I won't be caught", "I don't care for my life anymore" or "I didn't think at all in the moment"


Found the user who's never been behind bars.


Source: am criminal.
I don't think having been behind bars or not is relevant atleast here. Many murderers haven't been before when they did the crime. 
Then how do you know what goes through a criminals head when you aren't one?




Criminals do care for their own life, they just care less or none about yours.


Criminals do think in the moment. In fact they plan things ahead of time for that moment and after to get away with it.
You are actually not disagreeing with me. I presented three scenarios. Some criminals do things in affect "I didn't think at all in the moment".      
Some criminals are just done with everything and want to kill someone "I don't care for my life anymore"        
Or they knew beforehand and care for their own life but they think they can do it better than other criminals and become one of the many unclosed cases "I won't be caught"           
       
About your question how I can know what I didn't experience. I don't know the experience, I can only imagine or follow reasons. What I can absolutely do is read. I can read studies from people who researched criminals with first hand experience
...or a transgender person. 

....or any other mammal. 

....or any organism. 

Can't tell if trying to equate women to men and say woman are rapist too or...

If equating women to 11 year old victims and say men deserve death for raping women as well...

Hmm... 🤔

Either way I don't disagree with either both fit
Grammatically speaking: "man" is the subject of the sentence; so saying: "or a woman" contextually means: "women rape 11 year olds too". You can tell I know what I'm talking about by my fancy use of colons and semicolons in the preceding sentence.
I am an idiot. I understand. I wish I could have more of your understanding of this shit. It fucks me up so much. Now I am crying and idk.  Im really sorry.
even doubly sad since the UK has some big weird child abuse problem when it comes to politics and businesses.  yeah other countries have similar problems but the issue is like 10x worse than what a 1st world country like the UK should be dealing with.

Edit: ITT people offended at my use of the word banged.. As if I approve of what he did.   
I wasn't aware she was drugged and I was incorrectly saying he left to avoid arrest turns out he was avoiding punishment as he had already been found guilty.

Drugged and ass raped a 13 year old. 
Just google him. 
reddit is obsessed with Roman Polanski

he's an accomplished director that fucked a child in the 70s or 60s or something, some time after his wife and unborn child were murdered. i believe the girl was 13 or 14, so it's like a national tragedy on this website

it's like that "Nazi" or "Hitler" rule of the internet, -- basically any post on this website, given long enough, will eventually get to Roman Polanski and the girl he fucked 
Yeah, some fucked up things happened to him. Does not give him an excuse to flee the punishment frim his conviction.
i wasn't excusing what he did

It's not like he's some settled case that people keep dredging up. The guy's still alive, and still quite openly a fugitive. He's current, albeit a bit stale, events. 
he gets brought up in every thread that might have some obscure reference to the subject. reddit loves to talk about him, that's all i was saying
Fucked is one way to say drugged and ass raped.
Nice try, Tarantino.
what does he have to do with the Polanski case, did he fuck the child too?
Man, he just defended Polanski saying that 13 year old girl knew what she was doing.
So if some dude drugged your thirteen year old daughter/sister/niece/whatever, then anally and vaginally raped her while she begged him not to, you'd shrug it off with a "eh, fair enough" as long as he was talented? Or is it that you think raping young girls isn't that bad a thing to do? 
I hadn't heard of this either, just read his wiki page. While not defending what he's done dude has had a crazy life. Was stuck trying to survive ww2 on his own as a child in Poland, and had his friends and family murdered later in life. That's gotta fuck you up bad. I mean, still, don't rape kids, but there's at least a basis for him being justifiably insane.
>His arrest follows an American arrest warrant dating from 1978 against the filmmaker, in a case of morals.

A case of morals? It's a case of fucking drugged rape of a child.
Lmao, when Woody fucking Allen is on your petition to let off a rapist, you know that petition is wrong.
What a difference eight or nine years makes, right?

On another note, your screenname is my birthday. Hunh.
IIRC, he was awarded his last Oscar well after news of his conduct was made public. Also, he has received [numerous awards since 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski#Awards_and_nominations), just not Oscars.

**EDIT**: It's worse than I remembered, [he was convicted in 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski_sexual_abuse_case#Conviction_and_flight).
2003 considering he was charged in 1977 is still an indictment of some sick, sick puppies in the intervening decades. The right's demonising of Hollywood's degenerate behaviour is to the point of parody most of the time but sometimes they really, really go out of their way to earn it. 
There are quite a few people replying to you who apparently don’t know what “still” means.
He did get it right. The incident happened way before 2003 
He hasn't won any awards lately, but let's not pretend he's been ostracized in Hollywood.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/meryl-streep-applaud-roman-polanski/  (True)

If I were an A- list star, I'd use my resources to trick him into a movie read - then kidnap the MF'er stuff him in my duffle bag and drag him back to justice.


Do I need to put my pitchfork back into the case?
He was convicted in 77  that is way too fucking long to give attention to a kid fucker.
He left the country to avoid jail time. 
I know that, I have no clue why you told me that tho
Looking at his wiki page, he hasn't been nominated for an American award since 2002 - that's 16 years. (And before that, the last one was 1979). I think Hollywood's love of him is a little overblown on reddit. 

(What various actors have said is a different matter, but do they really represent Hollywood as an institution?)
I don't know about "a significant portion of Hollywood" but rather I'd say  "a few notable figures"
Yeah, it's pretty disgusting how H'wood had allowed him to remain in the industry and awarded and people are willing to work with him.
Including his victim.

> Geimer has publicly supported Polanski's view that he has served his time. He paid her a civil settlement of $500,000 plus interest.

> On 17 August 2017, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon rejected a request from Samantha Geimer to dismiss the case against Polanski.
There are so many people in this thread who apparently don’t know what “still” means.
This guy is a genius, still.
That’s what bothers me about this kind of thing. Some people that did amazing things also did really really horrible things. Am I supposed to hate something I like because the person behind it did something horrific? Because I’d rather just enjoy things for what they are and not really consider the people behind them.
No, I don’t think you have to hate his stuff. But you don’t have to give the man a standing ovation or defend what he did.
I go to my grave. A tongue shriller than all the trumpets calls me. 
Seems like one of those college brags that no one really believes.

"Brah, I killed her with my dick."
r/evenwithcontext
I remember a ruling by the Indian Supreme Court in which they handed over the death penalty. Like you said, the judges felt that the case in question fell in to the 'rarest of the rare' category- which they defined as crimes that outrage society (which I understood to be brutal/unusual crimes that have society baying for blood).
It's easier to catch and punish a rapist with a living victim than a rape/murder with no body. I think laws should generally be aimed at protecting innocents, which means critically examining the incentive structure those laws create for would-be criminals.
Yeah plus, I don't know if it's on the books in India, but I'm pretty sure mutilation of a corpse is a crime in itself.
But even that would be difficult to prove because without a body you can't really prove someone was murdered unless there is enough blood. Don't know how exactly the law is in India, but that leaves quite a few ways to avoid a murder charge I imagine. 
Yup, I can speak for the Brazilian scenario. People usually say the usual “the Law is to soft”, “we need death penalty” etc., but the real reason crime rates over here are out of control is  most crimes don’t even get investigated.

This “dark area” of crimes not reported/investigated on homicides was insane. If I’m not mistaken, only 5% had some attention from the police.

I’ve been trying to preach that if you want to improve the situation you need to improve the structure (police, public prosecution and defense), but most people think seeing big numbers on a few sentences is enough.
Its one of the many reasons why the death penalty is completely ineffective as a punitive measure for deterrence. No murderer is thinking about the consequences when planning to murder someone, and many people kill as a crime of passion in the moment anyways. 

Now its ineffectiveity has no real bearing on its constitutionality, but thats a whole different issue. 
Most politicians are criminals.
But do most criminals ever get caught? I doubt it.

That's fantasy thinking. "Criminals are irrational" is a way people try to ignore that *any* person is capable of committing a horrific crime. 

Marginalized and vulnerable people are routinely targeted because it's proven time and again that police won't take those cases seriously. The people who commit crimes against marginalized groups *know* what they're doing. It's not irrational, it's very common, and the mindset that "rational people don't actively seek to commit these crimes" really hurts people who are routinely targeted for horrific crimes and abuses.
Plenty of criminals are rational, just maybe a little lacking in the empathy department. Depends on the criminal, depends on the crime. 
Consequences for criminal activity do deter people from committing crimes. 

If there were no consequences, I'd have no problem going into a store and stealing a candy bar.  But the risks associated with the act of stealing are not worth the gain for me.  

People who do criminal activity do so because they are psychologically impaired, insomuch that they are compelled to preform the illegal act and are not thinking of the consequences, as you stated 

OR

the reward is greater than the risk. For example, if you are a person with no education, no property, no future prospects and no way to believe you will ever have any, than the risk of consequences, jail time, criminal record, etc won't deter you since you have nothing to lose. 


No, consequences aren't an effective deterrent for criminal activity. There is no correlation, that I'm aware, between severity of punishment and crime rates. For instance, states with capital punishment don't have lower incidents of murder than states who only imprison murders for life.

The reason is because people don't expect to get caught, or are acting in a moment of passion or impulsivity. 
>If there were no consequences, I'd have no problem going into a store and stealing a candy bar. But the risks associated with the act of stealing are not worth the gain for me.

Tells me a lot about you. How about morals? Don't you think it's wrong to just take something that doesn't belong to you? 
Attacking the person instead of contributing to the point on hand shows you don't have anything else of value to add to the discussion.  
I mostly agree with you, although I think for purposes of a thought experiment that horrifyingly harsh punishments might deter even some of the irrational criminal actors. Such actors might not be afraid of death, but they might be afraid of lifelong brutal torture. 
Maybe...even probably you are right.

But then you're living in a country which periodically horrifically tortures innocent people to death. 

And you need to find someone who is willing to do the torturing.

Also I'm pretty sure we went through a period of history doing that sort of thing in the middle ages and crimes still happened, so I'm not sure it entirely works.
Certainly we can build robots to perform the torture.
Oh I definitely wasn't advocating it. Just a thought experiment. 

>Also I'm pretty sure we went through a period of history doing that sort of thing in the middle ages and crimes still happened, so I'm not sure it entirely works.

Even the best measures can only reduce but not eliminate crime. There's only one thing I can think of that would eliminate crime: extinction of our species. 

I can't find the study right now but I remember reading a study that found that the length of a sentence had some effect on the amount of violent crime up to a certain point which was surprisingly low, something like 3 year or so. Whether you got 10 or 20 years made no difference. 

Actually now that I think about it, it might have been about recidivism amongst violent offenders, I can't be sure and I'm on my phone so cba to find the study.. anyways take my comment with a grain of salt.
Yes, what matters far more for deterrence than the length of the sentence is how likely they are to be caught.
There are probably some deranged people who in the moment would even choose to trade certain death or torture for the opportunity to satisfy their perverse desires.
Hey man, it seems like both you and the OP lost your cool, handled the situation terribly, however it seems like you both are very remorseful and are looking to move forward from the situation. I don’t think either of you guys should beat yourself up too much. You both dealt with immeasurable trauma as young individuals and it definitely impacts your behavior. I believe both of y’all are good people.
Politics, business, and the church. 
Well compared to hetero/homosexuals, pedophiles are relatively likely compared to end up doing "something" at some point in their life.

Of course thinking about it this probably has to do with the nature of their sexuality and the threshold when something becomes an offense - you don't get into trouble for downloading hetero or homo-porn but child porn... And if you flirt with people who are not into you (often even a bit underaged) you may end up with a reputation problem - but trying to pick up a girlfriend on the playground will get on a list... 

So in pure numbers they are relatively likely to end up with some kind of record even if they aren't/ may not be (exactly my point, who knows) more sexually aggressive than other people.
Don’t forget Tim Meadows!

Damnit.  I should read the words more often
Drugged her too
As the person above said, he didn't "bang" her.  He drugged her and then raped her, anally as well as vaginally.  She repeatedly told him no and asked him to stop.  The guy is a human trash fire.  
That seems like a great way to lure a criminal out.

"Hey! Look here! We got this amazing award for you, just don't mind these men in uniform!"
Not to be that person, but... He didn’t move abroad to avoid arrest. He was already arrested and convicted. He moved to avoid a jail sentence after conviction. 

This is an important distinction because you always hear “innocent until found guilty.” He was found guilty after due process, and has yet to serve his time. 
> Polanski banged a 13 year old.

He drugged her and vaginally and anally raped her. It was a lot more than statutory, which is how people might read what you wrote. 
He did not bang her, he anally raped her.
He was arrested got a plea deal and the judge disagreed with the agreed upon time to serve. So Polanski ran.
You just won a free boat!
And don't forget all the industry people who try to explain it away like it was okay. It was not okay.
Slight correction, he RAPED a 13 year old. 
Didn't he cosby the girl? Drug her all that? 
He drugged, raped, and sodomized a 13 year old girl. 
I think the word is rape, specially since it was unwilling sex by her account.
Just to add further details he didn't just "bang" her he drugged her and then raped her. Both are bad but the latter is way worse 
It is worth noting that he was offered a plea deal at the start of all this and took it, but then the prosecutor went back on it and that was  when fled. Not making excuses obviously, just adding context. 
He raped her. 
More like drugged and sodomized (raped) a 13yr
Banged? He gave her qualudes and anally raped her. Your version is light years more acceptable than what he actually did.
I'm not saying Polanski isn't a rotting, sack of shit, because he is. However, you should mention that after serving time in a Pyschiatric hospital for the same case, he came to a plea agreement of time-served and probation. The Judge told one of his associates he was going to sentence Polanski to 50 years, so Polanski fled.



What did the official sentence end up being? Or did sentencing never actually take place?
It never took place because he fled after his stint in psychiatric evaluation 
http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-polanski-rejected-20180108-story.html

Looks like he may be able to now. I was just going to ask about the statue of limitations regarding that.
The statute of limitations should not apply to a convicted criminal, it is more for an accusation.
How long is the prison sentence awaiting him?
Wasn't him getting awards for his stuff like 20 years ago?
No, also for more recent films like The Pianist (which is really excellent). When it won, he got a standing ovation from the theater.
> When it won, he got a standing ovation from the theater.

Which is why I never wondered  why it took so long for the sexual harassment scandals in Hollywood to come out.  The people enable these fucks.
And Roy Moore gets an endorsement from the president of the United States!!!
Sodomized a drugged 13 year old.

Btw, I just noticed his daughter is on Vikings.
Can’t they hire a bounty hunter of sorts to go fetch him?
That's kind of like a tl,dr. He actually was arrested. He fled because he had made a deal with the prosecutor like a ton of criminal cases do, but the judge publically admitted that he was going to ignore the prosecutor, and make an example out of Polanski. He was going to give him the harshest sentence, so Pola ski fled. Still doesn't chznge the fact that he raped a 13 year old at Jack Nicholson's house
Let's call it what it is. He drugged and raped her.
I hate to say this but the victim is making it even harder for justice. His victim did an AMA on Reddit. The entire time she was pretty much saying,"I got over it, so you should too and move on. It's not a big deal". Of course she got dragged from Redditors who said, "He's probably doing this to other little girls." Her response," No, he's not. Move on".
Polanski has enough connections so that he can avoid customs and come back to the country anytime he wants...our authorities are actively looking for terrorists and drug dealers entering the country on the regular... nobody is looking for Polanski.
IIRC it's not exactly that he left to avoid arrest, but he was given a plea bargain that excluded jail time and fleed when it was taken off the table.

So more that he fled to avoid being sentenced to prison. You know, after raping a child.
To be fair, maybe the awards are an elaborate trap to get him back stateside?  
He's free to return as the statute of limitations for his crimes have run out. 
No, he fled his sentence.  He has been convicted.
Why won't France extradite him?
France is notorious for not extraditing criminals. I forgot the cultural/legal reason why that is...
Because they're pussies and don'want to get involved. If the US really wanted him, all they'd have to do is wave a foriegn flag in France and they'd all surrender.
A lot of people, including some on Reddit find it more comfortable to ignore, dismiss and downplay child abuse than acknowledge it's significant presence in this world and be a part of the solution.
They still probably feel the same way. They just don't talk openly about it anymore. There's a good chance a few of them are even child molestors themselves.
What if they keep giving him awards to try, and trick him into coming back to the states?
I don't think it's just the right demonizing this stuff. What with so many actors getting testified against over all sorts of evil shit. 


I can’t tell you how much I appreciate these Hollywood types going out of their way to tell me how I should live my life so I can be a good citizen too. Thank you Hollywood!

Sarcasm off!
Hollywood isn't telling you how to live your life, they are selling you stories you want to hear because you see a better version of yourself in them. That is why they have any money at all. It is a multi-million dollar version of one of those motivational posters. The art of crafting stories is as old as time. The problem is as always when the messenger fails to practice what they preach, as is a common human shortcoming. 
When I say Hollywood I’m speaking more of the individuals involved in that club more than what they create. I don’t need an actor/actress getting on stage at an awards show etc telling me what’s right and wrong. 
He said 'he is still getting awards' implying the academy recognises him often, which is just not true. The man got a really controversial award 14 years ago. It is not like they took time out of the 2017 awards to honor him or something.
Sorry man. I don't like your facts as I'm already in throw a petulant fit. Please stop. 
No, no. Hollywood is a festering cesspool of loose morals that worships Roman Polanski, their dark lord of depravity. Don't you know this? 
Yeah I would say the numerous actors and film executives that supported him would comprise Hollywood as an institution. Hollywood values money not morals. Can you honestly say that had he only gotten a 3 month plea deal and he served it that Hollywood would have black listed him? 
He received a standing ovation when he won best director in 2003. Was that necessary? Major players in Hollywood has advocated that his conviction was unnecessary and he should be allowed back. 

They didn't care. 

Same with Woody Allen after the whole Soon-Yi thing and other reports. He got a pass, too. 
Well there's at least one convenient list:

http://www.indiewire.com/2009/09/over-100-in-film-community-sign-polanski-petition-55821/

- Paolo Sorrentino
- Alexander Payne
- David Lynch
- Wong Kar Wai
- Dardenne brothers
- Monica Bellucci
- Darren Aranofsky
- Wes Anderson
- Woody Allen
- Etc. 

Edit: Tarantino's defense of Polanski isn't terribly surprising, but least surprising has to be Harvey Weinstein's. Emma Thompson signed but reportedly (fashionably) later asked for her name to be removed.
The loud minority
Shocking. It as if enforcing laws somehow correlates with crimes going down. 
Isn't the death penalty normally reserved for first degree murder?
As a deterrent, maybe it doesn't work. but does it work to prevent further deaths in some cases? sure we can keep an individual locked up forever, is that more reasonable? honestly not sure myself.
Deterrent or not, it's better to have death penalty so we can remove as many of these monsters from earth as possible. Why keep them alive in the first place?
A certain percentage of these "monsters" are innocent people that have been wrongly convicted.  You can't release someone once their innocence had been established if they are dead.

Also cheering for the death of others is not an attitude suited to civilized people in a free society.  We should be striving to advance beyond the savagery of our ancestors, otherwise why have a society at all?
The BEST criminals! They *never* get caught, in fact they are almost a dynastic caste. 
Criminals who act logically enough not to be caught, so now we've isolated the problem.  To solve crime, we need to elect irrational, *caught* criminals.

Not sure why.  One can utterly destroy one life, the other hurts thousands or millions of lives.

Aw thanks that is so nice of you. Yeah I was totally wrong and being an asshole. They are being really nice and helpful now. I do feel bad that I went off the deep end without thinking or understanding their point of view but you’re right, we shouldn’t beat ourselves up. I’m just glad I can sometimes realize when I’m wrong.
I wasn't aware of that. 
I think the victim did an AMA on Reddit rather recently 
They do that sometimes. Fake lottery wins and such.
I've made more than 1 arrest by calling people who are wanted and telling them we found some lost property of theirs. If it's stupid but it works then it's not stupid. 
PA Anouncer: "Ladies and gentlemen, to present the newly-introduced Statutory Rape Lifetime Achievement Award, please welcome Academy Award-Winning writer/director/actor, Mr. Woody Allen..."

*APPLAUSE* 

Woody: "Jeez....thank you for the warm reception....very warm in fact....Our next award-winner is quite familiar with a warm reception, especially the one during his legendary performance that garnered him this new Oscar....even if the reception was small and quite reticent....which reminds me that I need to call my wife during the break...I love you Soon-Yi!

Starting this year, The Academy created a new Oscar for Best Male Statutory Rape of a Minor Lifetime Achievement Award. It is an honor to present this to such a maverick director, a true inspiration, and I can only hope to be so fortunate to receive this award a few years down the road...But let's not get some head for ourselves---I mean, not get *ahead of ourselves*.... Yeesh, that was quite the Freudian Slip. Which I'm well-known for delivering quite often....of course, I'm such a drastic case that it's...it's what my analyst calls a Freudian Wipeout! With all this talk of statutory rape, I'm getting very flustered....is it hot in here??....I'm really gonna need to schedule an appointment for tomorrow if possible. I know that's short notice, but so was the anal penetration of a minor girl by tonight's recipient...It really has been a long time coming, way longer than the few minutes it took in the bedroom of Jack Nicholson's house....Where's Jack? There you are, stop slumping in your seat, I can see you! Don't think we'd all forgotten about the all-access ass, I mean pass to your humble abode back in '77...

So, after 41 years of movie-making, star-making, and globetrotting, and without any further ado, ladies and gentlmen, please welcome the first recipient of the Best Male Statutory Rape of a Minor Lifetime Achievement Award, the legendary director...Mr. Roman Polanski! Come on up here Romie! Glad you were finally able to make it to----" 

*FBI Agents swarm the stage*

Agent: "GRAB HIM!!! Mr. Polanski you are being put under arrest and charged with multiple counts of statutory rape of a minor, contributing alcohol to a minor, and sodomy of a minor.....No...no sir...no you can't get your award real quick, there is no award for best rape....it was a setup to get you to sh.....no there isn't time to make a quick speech.....sir we'll explain everything in more detail down at the station...."
The amount of time you probably spent on this is both unnerving and commendable. 

Have an upvote.
Yeeaah I have/had gotten 5 hours of sleep total in the past two days and constructed it right before a nap hahah. Sleep deprivation is a Hell of a drug.
Thats how the VW guy got caught. 
[Simpsons did it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flAkPEeUhHY) (Kinda)
What happened was that he pleaded not guilty to six charges. Then the attornies of Samantha Geimer said that if he made a plea bargain he would only be tried for one of the six charges. So he did that and was going to be sentenced to 90 days of psychiatric evaluation and probation.

However, the judge apparently told one of Polanskis friends that he was going to ignore the plea bargain, that he himself had approved it, and sentence Polanski to 50 years in prison saying "I'll see this man never gets out of jail".

So it wasn't just that he skipped on the sentencing. But that the judge lied and was going to break a very heavy ethical ground rules of judging because of personal preference.
He spent 90 days in jail and was supposed to get probation after as part of a plea deal that was agreed to. The judge told some of his friends that he changed his mind and was going to ignore the plea deal and give him 50 years instead.
You’re leaving out a huge chunk: This was to be pending a psych evaluation that the judge granted a stay for because Polanski told him he was finishing a film (for which 400 jobs were on the line). The judge was lenient with him, but then regretted it when he saw a picture of Polanski partying with young-looking girls 10 days into the stay.  A friend then supposedly overhead the judge getting angry and threaten a 50-year sentence, so he phoned Polanski. 

When you include that, this is the story of a famous/wealthy middle-aged dude having sex with a 13-year-old, then being given an absurdly light plea agreement AND a stay of sentencing because of his status as a rich person/celebrity, who then heard a rumor that his misleading of the judge might affect the sentencing agreement so decided to use his richness/celebrity to shirk the law. By the way, the judge had said elsewhere that he was just planning to extend his sentence by 42 days and deport him... which is effectively what happened anyway. 

The irony of this back and forth is that I’ve loved a lot of Polanski films and will defend to my dying day their artistic merit. I just think his talent (or past trauma or the shadiness of his DA/judge) doesn’t excuse his actions. That said, it makes me a little sad that Polanski will probably never direct his own biopic because this seems like the sort of morally and psychologically complex story he excels at. 
But according to Whoopi Goldberg, it wasn't "rape rape".
Tarantino said she knew what she was getting into. 

* no I don’t agree with Tarantino. Just pointing out the Hollywood hypocrisy

It's not because of the sex, drugs and immorality of Hollywood. 

It's because despite it, they presume to look down their noses and sanctimoniously lecture the rest of us. 
>It's because despite it, they presume to look down their noses and sanctimoniously lecture the rest of us.

Nah, I think it is the sex and immorality. But, I don't know if Hollywood is as guilty of 'looking down' than say... Your republican politicians or the catholic church.
Kinda like republicans in Alabama that still supported Roy Moore. Rage about Hollywood by it was fine when it was one of their own. 
If it was actually about the sex and morality Donald Trump would not have an over 70% approval rating with Evangelicals. 

As for the Catholic Church I'd wager it varies by market and how strong they are in any given place. For a lot of US history they were pretty despised.  JFK getting elected was a very big deal.
Meanwhile, In Roy Moore's bedroom.... ^ifeelsick
Sounds a lot like our government officials. Maybe it's a money thing instead of a left or right thing? 
Definitely a money thing, and power that comes with it.
No, it is because violence against women is everywhere, and there is functionally lots of legal protections, but no actual legal recourse against sexual violence. 

It is your word against his, innocent until proven guilty (a noble principle which doesn't apply to the victim of rape, who is implicitly presumed guilty of lying making false accusations, if the accused is presumed innocent), so 99% of rapists walk free, and without ever being charged--thus also the necessity of extra-legal measures like #metoo, which use reputation rather than legal culpability to punish rapists. 

It is a left and right phenomenon equally, we all live in the same man's world, but the left criticizes and opposes this (however hypocritically) while the right openly supports the rapists' freedom to rape, under the banner of "traditional gender roles" and "focus on the family" (e.g. Roy Moore, Trump's grab them by the pussy comments)
>so 99% of rapists walk free, and without ever being charged

That sounds like bullshit to me. 
You’re joking, clearly. How did you pull that 99% stat out of your ass because it must’ve hurt. 
99 percent of rapists walk free? Bullshit. They are walking free because we can’t prove them to be rapists. Would you rather we presume everyone guilty and have massive fucking witch hunts at the mere accusation of rape? What about if a woman rapes a man? Would you still want innocent until proven guilty to be thrown out the window? 
Man, people really do just stop giving a shit that a person raped a 13 year old girl given time, dont they?
No. I am not at all implying he deserved the award, or it isn't a big deal that he got it. My point is quite simply, that it was 14 years ago and he hasn't been awarded since.

People need to stop looking for motives in reddit comments. I am not defending the academy, I am not defending Polanski and I am not supporting the metoo movement. Literally just stating a fact.
Good Lord, Reddit is killing it today!
Are there any instances where someone wins Best Director and *doesn't* get a standing ovation?  It seems to me that's one of the biggest, most prestigious Oscar awards and so probably always gets one of the biggest applauses along with Best Actor/Actress and Best Picture.

That said, if someone knows about the whole Polanski scandal, they might not applause on principle, but how many of the people in that theatre really know all the details?  It might be more a matter of going with the crowd, going with tradition, and operating on ceremony - i.e. you always stand and applaud for Best Director - rather than some explicit symbol of approval for Polanski's private life.

Anyway, I'm just playing Devil's advocate here; I don't know enough about Hollywood or the Oscars to do more than hypothesize.
Assuming that he deserved the award on its merits, which IMHO he did, then that was absolutely appropriate. They were applauding his work and by extension him purely in a professional capacity, not his personal life.   
Gary Oldman just received a standing ovation for winning an Oscar too. Hollywood will never change. 
Really, Wes Anderson?! Shitty...
So there is a little context with that. Polanski was arrested at an arts festival in a country that doesn't extradite to the US. A lot of people who signed that letter were outraged that an art festival wasn't safe and worried that this would lead to the arrest of political filmmakers wanted in their home country (think Ai WeiWei). Many of them removed their name from the list after he was released because it was mostly about the arrest and not the man. 

That doesn't mean they can't be a piece of shit who wants to defend a rapist. Lots of people on that list did also say awful things about the incident, and if the last year has taught us anything it's that sexual assault in Hollywood has never been given the right amount of attention. But signing the list all by itself isn't a tacit approval of underage rape.
I’m not sure why. But Tilda Swintons support of Roman Polanski surprises me. It doesn’t seem consistent with my interpretation of her as an actor.
Exactly.  "Over a hundred" sounds like a lot, but actually scan the list and you'll see there are relatively few "notables", as I said.  I'm still disappointed in pretty much the entire list you posted, however, especially Lynch, Aranofsky, and Wong Kar Wai.  Woody Allen is no surprise though, lol.
Tilda Swinton doesn’t surprise me. 
Why is that?
Neither does Woody Allen
not like this. not like this
>least surprising has to be Harvey Weinstein's

"No, Harvey, we're not including your statement. You're supposed to be defending the 'film' part, not the 'rape' part." 
Tilda Swinton too? :(
Exactly. I read a story on an article some time ago (there was no source for it, so take it as you want), telling that, back in the day, London citzens were mostly pickpocketed when watching the public execution of another thieves.

Even if that is not true, the story serves as a good analogy.
Yes because the people did not premeditate it they are considered less dangerous. 

I was meaning that since it only applies to First degree murder anyways and is ineffective for that 
And cop murder
Show me the studies saying zero innocent people have ever been executed for a crime and I'll support the death penalty. Unfortunately that is far from the case. Countries that aren't shitholes don't have the death penalty.
So the us is a shit hole?
I mean at this point...

Death penalty isnt solely responsible for it, but the attitude that supports it certainly played its part. 
I was with you until the last sentence. A country can be a great place to live and still have issues in need of resolution.

Realizing when one is wrong is a true cornerstone of civilization! If you couldn’t do that you’d still be yelling at this other poster as opposed to attempting to make amends and perhaps even find comfort or solace in one another!
Hollywood was though. And he is still celebrated by them.
I imagine she wasn't either
They did that with the Washington Redskins in the 80's. They arrested 101* people, including some top 10 fugitives from DC. One of the names they used was Cran, because it's 'narc' backwards. The company giving away the tickets used an acronym used by law enforcement as well.
Like when they send you a bogus prize certificate saying you won a free motor boat but when you get there they arrest you and beat you to the full extent of the [law](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=flAkPEeUhHY) .
When has this happened. Not trying to be argumentative, I just wanna read the story.
It probs wouldn't work on a rich dude like Polanski. He'll just remain chilling in his hood, soaking up his lavish lifestyle.
I was under the impression judges can overrule a plea bargain if they feel justice isn’t being served

>The Defendant: Yes.

Legally, Polanski was told that the Judge could easily throw him in prison for twenty years if he plead guilty when he plead guilty. 
So the prosecution offered a plea bargain and the judge wasn't going to accept? I was under the impression that judges don't have to accept plea bargains if they feel they are too lenient.

>So he did that and was going to be sentenced to 90 days of psychiatric evaluation and probation

It seems perfectly reasonable that a judge would deny this plea bargain for someone who drugged and raped a child
You are right, it was a plea agreement and later Polanski/the defense team alleged that the DA had one-sided discussions with the judge after the plea agreement. There was a big thing a way back about it because the DA said he suggested a harsher sentence in a documentary, then retracted the statement saying he was playing things up to the camera for the director. 

But even if all of that is true, Polanski still had sex with a child and admitted to it in court. Sure he tries to point out any unfairness in his case (most criminals do and it’s good to question judges’ motives) and tries to justify his crime by saying the girl was willing. But let’s be clear: I don’t care how “mature” or “willing” a 13-year-old seems, he or she is a child and the ethical (and legal) adult interaction with them is to not fuck them.  Even if a kid is throwing themselves at you (which doesn’t seem to be the case according to the victim’s testimony, since she says she was drugged and repeatedly said no), they’re not old enough to give informed consent, and your job is to be a grown-up and tell them it’s inappropriate. 

I’m all for looking at the nuances of these things, and your points are important to this story, but I don’t like the tendency I’ve seen of dismissing the severity of the crimes committed against the girl. I just wanted to flag that he admitted to the crimes and evaded sentencing (a pretty severe crime itself). I’m not losing any sleep over the fact that Polanski isn’t allowed back here. 
Whoopi is a sickening person, she has been advocating for this guy forever. 

Hollywood is fucking twisted, where else can someone be convicted of drugging and sodomizing a 13 year old and people still have your back just because you're talented? It's not like he was wrongly accused, he very clearly did it.

And I read the account, they weren't "dating" she wanted to be a model, he picked her up from her mom's house, had a photo shoot with her, he took her to Jack Nicholsons house and gave her booze and benzos and then he sodomized and raped her then dropped her off back home. Why the fuck does Hollywood give this guy a pass? 

Edit: Removed the part about France,  some quick Google- fu shows that Polanski has duel French and American citizenship and France doesn't extradite it's own citizens, that's why they don't ship him back here to serve his sentence.
If drugging and sodomizing a child isn't rape, what the fuck is whoopi?
Oh she also defended Bill Cosby until the victim count reached like 50 lol. 
If you get raped you just need to enjoy it - Bobby Knight
> according to Whoopi Goldberg

Stop making stupid people famous.
What? She was 13, legally she had no idea what she was getting into
And he later apologized for saying that and admitted he was wrong.
Don't ever meet your heroes IRL.
And he took it back and personally apologized to the victim for the things he said. He admitted he didn’t have all the facts, and spoke out of ignorance.

I think the letter reads as more than simply a concern about fallout for future political agitators -- it calls the rape of a child "a case of morals." 

It also adds that:

> Filmmakers, actors, producers and technicians — everyone involved in international filmmaking — want [Polanski] to know that he has their support and friendship.

That's setting aside the questionable idea that arts festivals should somehow be sacrosanct and shield their participants from the legal consequences of their actions. 
Your point was regarding deterrence, first degree murder obviously takes that into play more than crimes of passion. 
The idea that people who kill other people due to suddenly losing their emotional and rational composure are less dangerous than people who make a reasoned decision that another person needs to die and then carry out a plan to follow through on that decision seems suspect to me. 
Just remember "Shit rolls **DOWN**hill" for a reason officer! 

edit: because cronyism/corruption completely crumbles without it!
Zingggggg
Na she lost the election.
Hollywood loves rapists. 
Nothing’s really changed since then.
To be fair he fled the country in 1978 and won an award in 2010.  In jollywood it's hard to remember who is a rapists for that long
Seems a little ironic they celebrate him, keep it hush hush with the Weinstein situation but god forbid they let anyone say grab by the pussy. 

As long as someone is saying it and not doing it it must be a bad thing. /s

Oh the woes of Hollywood. 

Edit to add: I have a pussy. I’m not offended by it because I know I’ve said dirty things as well. 

I’m offended by people thinking rape is okay and doing nothing about it in fear of their jobs or whatever excuse they come up with. 
oh look another user from the_donald trying to push this narrative while simultaneously supporting a party that tried to elect roy moore and y'know the orange guy with multiple sexual assault cases
now i know why Homer wanted that beautiful, beautiful motorboat... da da nah nah nah naaaah
That just seems like a Chris Hansen with extra steps.
I remember this happening people thought they got free tickets or money to be picked up. 
Great 30 for 30 about this.

Yes, but they cannot legally (at least since the 2000s) make a plea deal harsher than it is after everyone has accepted it. Not to mention it's just not ethical in terms of common sense. You can't tell someone 'your punishment is 90 days of psychiatric evaluation and probation' and then at the sentencing say 'Psyche! I'm actually giving you 50 years in jail' without them having commuted any further crimes or illegal actions to change the circumstances.
>I was under the impression judges can overrule a plea bargain if they feel justice isn’t being served

Judges need to approve plea bargains. If a judge approves a plea bargain, with the intent to not actually follow through with the approval, that's pretty unethical.
Well the thing is that I believe he accepted the plea bargain considering that Polanski changed his statements from not guilty of any charges to guilty of one of the six charges. It wasn't that he denied the plea bargain. It's that the judge was planning on reneging on the plea bargain and giving him 50 years of jail time. Which is an ethically bad thing as he had already accepted the plea bargain.

I'm not saying that the plea bargain was good. No it was a cop out and he should have gotten jail time for it. He should have been prosecuted originally to al most the full extent of the law. However, what I am saying is that the judge was ethically wrong and should have never accepted the plea deal originally if he was planning on reneging it and that Polanski did have a right to flee in that situation.
Neither am I. I think he should have served jail time and been put on the sex offenders registry if not also deported from.the country. However I think that his flee from the United States was justified and the only reasonable thing to do now is preform a retrial on him and have him serve the sentences given by that.

Let me be clear, the actions he took on Samantha are incredibly heinous and I am not absolving him of that.
> Why the fuck does Hollywood give this guy a pass?

You know why. Roman Polanski is a rich and powerful director- he does good movies, makes people money, etc. What's some random girl in comparison?



If you think all people have an equal right to dignity, you'll vehemently disagree with that. If you think that you only gain a right to dignity from power and achievement, it makes intuitive sense. 
Most people in France don’t like him. Some of the elites do, much like in the US.
That's really dissapointing. I knew about Polanski, the dick, but I didn't know that about Whoopi defending him. I used to like her. (never watched the View which probably helped)
>  like to hear that one explained

France is a different country from USA, they don't enforce US laws for US crimes in France.  They may not like Polanski, but  not prosecuting a US crime in France isn't the same as loving and forgiving him.

Edit: ditto not extraditing a French citizen for a us crime. Poland too refused to extradite him as a polish citizen as the court felt California was unlikely to [give him a fair trial](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/world/europe/roman-polanski-extradition-poland.html). Switzerland arrested him on behalf of the us, but later refused to extradite



Washington ...... let’s not forget. Roy Moore lost by like 1% and the republicans would have welcomed him with open fucking arms. 
I didn't know about the Jack Nicholson aspect.

Try your church on Sunday.
Woody Allen...
France did not have a minimum age of consent until very recently. They finally joined the rest of the civilized world last month, but prior to that it was perfectly fine for grown men to have sex with 11 year old girls. That's why they didn't bat an eye when Polanski raped a 13 year old.

No one is allowed to talk about this but the fact of the matter is there's a Jewish aspect to this. You can rape children do drugs even kill people and as long as you aren't considered anti-Semitic you will always have a career in Hollywood.

Polanski a Jewish director was shielded by Jewish Hollywood Elite. And there's a reason behind that we can go into it, it's a long talk, but it basically is summed up by ethno cronyism. "You are one of us so we will have your back no matter what"

The moment you look at it this way everything Hollywood does make sense. Which is why you are not allowed to look at it this way.
Whoopi sucks vagina
>what the fuck is whoopi?

Whoopi is an old fashioned term that means sex, I've heard it on Family Fued a lot. 
Step up your comma game, bro. 
Whoopie is what they would say instead of sex in "risque" 70's gameshows.  There's [hardly any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xq0-A09XiA) overlap, because they were generally looking for answers that were consensual.

She also defended Michael Vick. She said that what they were doing was a normal in parts of the South. As if a wealthy football player and his friends hanging dogs and burying them in the yard if his estate was a "cultural" thing. 

I know this. You know this. Quintin Tarantino said on Howard Stern she knew what she was getting into. 

* I’ll never understand Reddit for downvoting facts they don’t like. 

https://youtu.be/R16dFv6y10c
What do you mean legally know getting into? There's no such thing either she or she didn't, and whether she or didn't it doesn't matter he knows the law.
He apologized because of the backlash imo. He believed what he said on Howard. But if other people want to accept his apology, that’s a personal choice. I personally don’t buy it. 
No he didn't. He claimed he was playing devils advocate incorrectly to be provocative but if you know the context on the Howard Stern show where he said those words you know that isn't true.
Yeah but there is a weird fine line for what constitutes "pre-meditation" in the USA. I've seen interviews with legal experts who state that in some cases if you "pre-meditate" for even a couple of seconds you can potentially be considered a first degree murderer. 

Bottom line: don't murder people. 
Usually pre-meditated murder is still done by people with deep psychological pathologies.

They do plan. They are acting with a logic.  But it's usually very twisted.  Either hardened mafia/gangster types who aren't scared to die.  Or whacko killer types motivated by bizarre fetishes.  Either way, they're not typically the people swayed by consequences either.

Besides, there's a metric fuckton of data from all different countries about this that all agrees--the death penalty is not a deterrent.

In fact, in the US, states that banned the death penalty 150+ years ago (New England and Upper Midwest) tend to have the lowest murder rates and states still frying people tend to have the highest (South).

If 150+ years of this shit didn't move the needle in your favor yet, it's probably not going to tomorrow either...
