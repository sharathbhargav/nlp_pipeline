Ken M off
It is my dream that I might someday see a wild Ken M in his natural habitat.
This is peak Ken M
7:11 lolol
We are ALL 7 11's on this blessed day!
"Word of God", "word of God's son", word of God's other sons/daughters. Everything can be messed up when there is no logic, reasoning, common sense, and/or basic human decency
KEN M YOU ANIMAL! LOL
Bravo Ken, bravo!
Yahoo has a search engine? 
At least he’s progressive :)
John 7:11 is my favourite passage.
Chapeau
Ken M is a master fisher of men as this post beautifully illustrates. Ken casts out with the first remark, the second is wiggling of the lure and he reels him in with the hitter when he gets a bite.
I'm going to start using John 7 11
this is like when that celebrity got boring for awhile but then became interesting again!
we live in a society
What's the best you haven't seen?
I agree, Bill O'Riley's video was indeed very interesting 
>John 7:11

Bottom text 
All of it
Pastor says if we have to use the John at a 7-11 we are to stare straight ahead to avoid impure thoughts
When his grandson gave up his $6k figure job to become the new pastor on this blessed day. It's by far the best but I've never seen it.
:(
The John is ALL 7 11's on this blessed day!
Speak for yourself.
This really says a lot about 
Ye
Sientists say there are only six Ken M posts we haven’t discovered yet.
But all thoughts are sacred because they are created in God's thoughts's image.
