Kitten rescue.

I winced every time a car passed by or OVER the poor thing. 
That was terrifying!! Poor little thing. That guy is a freakin’ superhero.
Wow I’m glad nobody ran into him. Some lady got put in jail for stopping for ducks on a highway and causing a crazy accident.
That guy is a hero in my eyes.

Several years ago I saw some guy in a big ass truck toss a kitten out of his window passing by our house. I noticed something squirming in the street and instantly ran out, I put my hands up as cars were coming at me. In that moment I was willing to die for something so innocent. When I got it it couldn't meow or cry it laid there gasping. I brought it to the front porch where my mom and uncle and cousin stood around me. Unfortunately, as the truck was moving, he had hit her. She laid in my arms in her final moments, as I pet her and poured as much love as I could. A state trooper came by with a box, helped me gently lay her in it, and patted my back and asking if I would be okay. I will never forget that poor kitten, but my mom reminds me from time to time that the kitten had the best last moments a cat could have.
That's kitnapping. 
I couldn't possibly have ever figured out what was going on in the gift without the very important text!
That was so hard to watch.
That was terrifiying and on top of that the guy kidnaps that little kitty. Oh man how far have we fallen down^^^^/s
Someone tried to do the same with a family of duck on a highway. At the same time as someone opens the door to go help the ducks, a motorbike passes next to the car, ending up right into the door. The driver of the motorbikes and his daughter (on board) died. The woman whom opened the doors ended up with 90 days in prison. Here's a link to the article

--Edit--
-Looks like the doors part is fake, dunno why I remembered it that way, thanks to u/atomofconsumption for pointing that out
i feel bad for both the kitten and the guy lost them
r/nonononoyes
Poor thing must have been traumatized by the experience
Did someone throw their kitty out on the highway? I would love to throw them on the highway and see if they get hit.
How to obtain a cat:
FREE CAT?  HELLS YEAH!
Is that guy not wearing shoes? 
A peugot driver.... Hmm
Russian guy “ I’m yours now.” 
Every time a truck went by I froze up, even knowing it would be saved judging by the title.
The little kiss the driver gives the kitten where it's finally safe was more satisfying than the rescue. 
I thought this was gonna turn into r/watchpeopledie
I never understand this.. why do all those people pass up the opportunity to pet a little kitten and possibly take it home?
/r/ANormalDayInRussia 
Thank god people put their own lives and other meaningless human lives at risk for a feline.  

Truly a Soviet hero eh comrades? 
They gif made it seem he threw her out the window at the end
Looks like the 5th vehicle hit the wall avoiding the kitten.
Driver from Bryansk,Russia.great man
I mean still illegal and could cause a lot more damage but cool stuff
Man,johnny sins really can do all sort of things.
This poor little **kitten**



Got **stuck on** a large highway



after **falling out** of an suv

Dear god I hate these gifs
nonononononononononononononononoyes!
I’m not crying. You’re crying!
that little fella had a maxed out luck-stat
why did they loop the footage to make it seems like more cars than there were?
This made me so nervous!

ugh my first thought was that he ate the cat when he got home...  whats wrong with me this is so sweet 
>inb4 some lady did this and caused a crash resulting in her getting charged with manslaughter
Someone did that for a family of ducks in Montreal, couple years ago. On an highway...in the left lane ...

Then 2 bikers rear ended the stopped car and died on impact. Driver was sentenced to 1 year imprisonment for lack of fucking judgment...
Sorry but it’s not ok to stop in a lane like this. That guy was risking the lives of everyone else in the car, not to mention whoever might have hit them. 
Kaliningrad. KALININGRAD? Its called Königsberg!
You mean germany?
Anyone wants to go a diffrent planet where we treat living things as we should?
Turn on your hazard lights
The second car is the worst. 
I know he's trying to save a kitteh... But he stopped on a busy highway and didn't even turn on his emergency blinkeres. Could have very easily ended in disaster. 
Plot twist: he took it home to cook it 
He took him home and ate him in a stew. 
He's like "Mmmm fuck yeah. Kitten soup.".
Yum, dinner! /s

Same, I'm so fucking stressed by this gif
Dude’s fast motion waddle back to his car though: “Ooh, free kit! Mine mine mine mine let’s go home”
All the cars move to avoid it. You can see that almost every car moves towards the other lane. It's the trucks which go over the kitten. You can see the first one makes quite a large swerve to ensure the kitten is in the centre under the truck. The trucks can't just move out the way because they are too large and would invade too much of the next lane.
Me too. After the second car I glanced up to see what sub this was to let me know if I was about to be happy or sad. 
Especially on a Russian highway. Based on the videos I've seen, this guy truly risked his life for this kitten.
unless of course because he stopped 12 other cars would crash into him and kill dozens of people.

Don't stop on the highway!
Yup, here it is: http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/canadian-woman-prison-time-duck-car-crash-article-1.2051060
It is reckless to stop like that in the middle of the highway and if it causes an accident the person should be punished for it.
After the incident, a local news channel tracked down the hero, and found out what happened to the kitten afterwards.
The man's name is Denis Degtyarev, 43, from Kaliningrad. "The kitten turned out very small, not even able to eat, so he took him to the sports school, where his children were, and with the help of good people, they found him a new home," said Degtyarev .

Well. I just cried. You are good human 
The worst thing I’ve ever witnessed was a kitten in traffic. My friends and I were heading to get food when we got a stop light. As we sat I noticed something a little ahead in the lane next to us.   “What is that?” I said to the other two guys. After a few seconds we realize it’s a tiny grey kitten.  We all collectively threw open our doors(which probably wasn’t a smart idea) and were about to leap into action when a shitty bleach blonde woman in a giant suv ran it over.  The buddy that was almost there let out a roar of distress as it happened.  He picked him up and carried him to the car, it was hurt badly and not doing well.  It died before we could even get through the light.  This is the only time I’ve seen either of these two friends openly cry.  We cried the entire way back to my house with my buddy clutching this tiny puff of fur.  He is buried on the side of my house next to my family dog.  I think about my buddy and that day every time I go home to visit.  Atleast for those last moments he was held by somebody that truly felt for him. 
Have my upvote 
You are a hero in my eyes
Did the truck driver throw cut onions also? Cos damn.
Well if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go take a shower so I can't tell if I'm crying or not
Fuck, man. Thank you so much for maybe helping that poor little kitty be less scared while he passed. :( You did a beautiful thing. 
As I was reading I was preparing myself for a u/shittymorph post but was glad it wasn’t!  Good job.
I believe you because this is the internet.
Cat burglar strikes again  
r/sweatypalms
you've completely made up the part of the door.

the car was just parked in the middle of the road on a bend in the highway! it says so in the article you posted.
[deleted]
Maybe I'm just a pessimist but the SUV owner probable threw it out. 
Right? I assume he has a window open or something, and didn't realise the cat could climb out, but that's going to be a disappointing and confusing time when he gets to his destination.

"Hey, daughter dearest, I've got a surprise for you..."
It's awful but you are risking your own life and the life of others by stopping in traffic.
because it's an active highway. no offense to the kitten, but I wouldn't have stopped.


Because people get killed all the time doing stuff like this.
I mean, stopping in the middle of a busy highway isn't exactly safe. It was amazing for the guy to stop, but he took quite a risk.
Probably have work to do
And risk its life by letting it continue to be stuck in the middle of a freeway
yes sure let's go to one of all those other planets with living things
Everyday.
They are on...
What?
But now i'm happy to know that the little kitty is now in safe hands.
And a fine stew was made on that blessed day of meaty findings.
But it looks like the trucks manoeuvre in the opposite direction as the get fairly close to the kerb 
/r/anUnusualDayInRussia
There was a woman in Québec who stopped to help some ducklings on the highway. A father and daughter on a motorcycle hit her car and both died. In her case she didn't even put her blinkers on and she left her door open! Good intentioned dumb mistake took 2 lives.

Very bad idea to stop on a highway!
Wait, one story says she wanted to capture them, another says she just wanted to stop

What is reckless is having a system that creates this issue in the first place. If the highway system can't handle having an emergency stop then the highway system needs to be reworked.

This is the very definition of a "no, you move" situation.


My first understanding of this was that the kitten wasn't big enough to be eaten. But that is a lovely story and I'm happy the kitten is enjoying its new life!
This makes me incredibly happy. If we could save these innocent animals, even once in our lives, then I feel like we would have done something impactful towards our world.
Did they also track down the driver who threw a cat out of a moving vehicle onto a busy highway?
Thank you. I'm a cat spotter by nature, I was just happy to get the poor thing off the street. I've been having a hard week, and just remembering this and typing it out makes me realize how fleeting everything is.
Oh good god I'm sorry you and your friends had to experience that. T_T 

Pretty sure I'd total my car before running over any animal, let alone a kitten. 

*sobs in a corner*
Thank you for trying your hardest. Sometimes, these things are meant to happen. That kitten had the best life for it in its final moments, and even though he didn't get to live a full cat life, he got the love he deserved. Cats, regardless if they're ours, are our family. 
should have tossed the carcass on that blond womans car
Thank you. I was just doing what I thought was right. As soon as I realized what it was, it was as if all thought just left me and all that mattered was the kitten that needed my help.
Thank you. I remember him not struggling anymore in my arms in the quiet of the porch. I pet his back and side and tried to keep his airways open. My mom says she heard him faintly purr. I nearly died as the kitten expelled his bladder. He went peacefully.
Oh no ! It's a old story, my sick mind might have added a twist to it. No bad intention intended, I will edit my post. Thanks for pointing that out
I've also read it happened at night.. A tragic situation but it's very different from stopping on a straight stretch with your lights on mid-day. Ideally drivers should be aware and alert enough to notice traffic stopping ahead of them because it happens all the time due to congestion and wrecks.
According to the wife of deceased (she was driving next to him), they were driving around 80-90km/h, which is too fast to react properly but it's a typical (even a bit slower than the usual) speed on a highway
Actually, carelessly opening your door into traffic is an offense in most places. Mainly because it's extremely dangerous for cyclists. 
are you delusional? it was on a highway, how slow do you think most vehicles would be moving? 
I thought it fell out from under the vehicle. Kittens get up into vehicles like that and fall out at some point. You never even know it happens till you can't find the kitten any more. Happens a lot on farms.
I would say correct but my source isn't reliable and I don't think you'll believe me as I don't have it anymore

A 4chan thread has been created about it where the OP asked about the SUV. One of the answers was from someone in the state learning that they tracked down the SUV's licence plate and he owner was in prison for animal abuse (don't remember the length). The thread was later deleted with time.
Victim blaming. The situation shouldn't cause the issue in the first place. If the highway can't handle emergency stops then the highway system needs to be reworked. 

Besides. Over-driving your ability to stop is the only way something bad would happen and that would be on the fault of that driver. Over-driving your ability to stop really needs to be illegal. Tailgaters should get DUI level fines.
I don't think I would have stopped instantly, but I definitely would have circled round, approached at lower speed with hazards on before stopping.
Worth it.

Yeah, guess he reacted late and oversteered towards the curb. Kinda looks like he bounces off.
idk if unusual, russians fucking love cats
 So every highway system in the world needs reworked then... I'm sure they'll get right on that. 
Smart of them to fatten him up first.
That's true!! Nowadays humanity is completely lost, such incidents are really appreciative.
That's why you enjoy what you have, or make the most of it. Cause there's no second chance
I would do the same, my parents also have a small pond right next to their house so when I lived there it was a regular thing to check the road for any turtles trying to cross and help them from one side to the other. I just don’t think the person driving saw it, was extremely small :(. 
I’m an animal lover, but I’ve discovered for myself that’s not true. I was on a 4 lane road, with a grass median, between two ponds. A mother duck and probably 6 ducklings tried to cross the road right in front of me, on my left side. There was a car in front of me, a car to my right (and another car behind him), and a car right behind me. There was nothing I could do. I missed the mother but hit the first 2 ducklings. The car to my right hit the mother. The remaining ducklings stayed on the grass medians crying for their mother. It was AWFUL. But I instinctively couldn’t hit people in cars to save the ducks. I pulled into a parking lot and called my dad, as I sobbed. I remembered two things: at least it wasn’t a person, and at least it wasn’t a pet. Still, every time I drive by that spot, I physically tense up and get close to tears. It sucked.
Most days I wish we had gotten to it before anything happened but have come to terms with how everything came out.  Since though we each have a cat that we rescued, one that was found during a bad thunderstorm separated from its mother (we also tried to find her and the rest of the litter but with no luck) and the other when there was a terrible flood that displaced a few shelters. So even though we lost one 4 have been rescued.
To be honest I don’t think they even knew what had happened so it’s pretty unfair of me to harbor such a hatred for them but we did share some choice words about her for a few weeks after.
You people always trying to push your anti-door agendas... It sickens me. ^^/s
I would also consider driving speeds...even if people *should* be able to stop, requiring them to do that and then merge into another lane is in my eyes pretty irresponsible if the people here are driving much faster than 50/km/h or so (I don't think they do).
I miss read, I thought the car had stopped at a stop sign area or light for some reason to let the animals cross the road 
I think that was around a corner in a passing lane...
Yeah true! At least the kitten was okay, didn’t know a video could stress me out so much. 
No, they just need somewhere people can stop in an emergency. All highways in the world will need major work done on them eventually, and when that happens maybe just add frequent areas to pull off or make the shoulders larger.
You save the ones you can. That's all you can do.

My dad worked construction and would regularly come home with turtles he saw stranded on the side of busy roads. I'd help them get better, and then we'd release them on our quiet street. We were surrounded by good habitats for them to thrive. I had one that snuck away for a split second while we were in my sandbox. I made my dad dig it all up to find the thing. Never found it.
You know what, your comment reminded me of something similar that did happen to me. Except it was a squirrel. I did slam on my breaks, luckily I was on a quite subdivision road, but still felt the *thud* as my tire went over him. I guess I suppressed it because I hate admitting I killed an innocent creature.


That's amazing! Make sure to give those cats all the love from a random redditor!

All of my cats were rescues as well. Not from shelters, but from off the street, or from friends who rescued a pregnant cat. I have two that are sisters born exactly a year apart! (they look nothing alike).

I had one that died a year ago. A neighbor ran him over on accident, she felt so bad because she didn't know. I had to be the one to identify him because my dad couldn't tell (even though he was wearing my collar). I got him from our dog groomers, said he'd been saved from a storm drain separated from his mother. He was hardly a few weeks old when we got them, I can only imagine the hardships he had to live until we got him. He's buried right outside my window next to my mother's dog. I have pictures of him in our home, and a memorial by the front door. It's the least I could do.
All good. These things can be complicated with many variables. 

Gotta be vigilant out there on the roads. 
I will :), not that they don't basically rule the house anyways.   
   
Street cats have such interesting and varied personalities, an older cat I had in the past was a street cat named jumpsforscratch (literally would do anything for pets, hold your hand up just out of reach, would repeatedly jump and touch his head on your hand until you pet him).   
   
Im sorry to hear about your kitty though :(, its that reason I don't let me current one out.  I live on a pretty busy street and wouldn't be able to deal with finding him on the road one morning on the way to work.  He does have plenty of room and 2 other kitties to play with so he's pretty cool with his life.
Yeah. I have a strict policy on that. It's my dad who let him out, unfortunately. He doesn't like cats and doesn't care for them in the house. He's repeatedly threatened to throw them out on the street. It's one of the main reasons that he and I don't get along anymore. We're housemates at this point.

I do have one outdoor cat, but she just lazes out in the lanai (family cat). My mom's used to get out and sit on the roof and chase squirrels and other creatures (we haven't had a rodent issue. Ever). My oldest will run out but then run back in because I'm not out there. She used to just sit outside in the front and I would sit on the concrete and just watch her brush herself with it. She'd chase lizards and squirrels if they got too close. Then she'd sit by my feet until she was ready to go inside. My youngest came after the cats unexpected death, and she's never been allowed outside, even on a collar or leash. I don't want her to want to go outside when my dad gives her an opportunity. Thankfully, she's never gotten the idea to do it, despite many times she could.
