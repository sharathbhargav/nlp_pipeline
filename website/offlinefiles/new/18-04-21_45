Pretty sure kids will gladly substitute "your dad" in place of "your mom" without missing a beat.
Yo mama is so ugly she turned your dad gay.
Yo daddy so gay he cried when he found out Dick's was a sporting store

Yo daddy so gay when he's asked what is his position in his company, he answers "bottom"

Yo daddy so gay he calls your other daddy 'daddy'
Oh no, those poor heterosexual women raised by lesbian mothers won't be prepared for dad jokes :(
I feel sorry for kids with two dads. They have to deal with twice the number of dad jokes 
“Yo egg donor / surrogate mama got so much traffic round her vag, they ^introduced ^^some ^^extra ^^^traffic ^^^congestion ^^^^measures or something.”
But it opens the gate for "My dad could beat up *both* your dads."
And then the whole bus stood up and clapped
Yo papa
Yo dad's so gay that he's super happy because that's what gay means!
Hilariously adorable. 
The other dad..Albert Einstein
It was high school for me when I started hearing the fag and takes it up the jokes. Just wait. Teenagers are creative with cruelty
Is this true power
Both.
r/Wokekids
very eloquent for a 12 year old 
Everyone gay or not has a MAMA
Everybody gets their own superpowers.  Just gotta find out what they are.
That kid is going to get blitzed when he gets to high school
I have a lot of faith in the young generation today. They might have their heads buried in technology, but hopefully that exposes them more to the fact that people are different; skin color, sexual orientation, whatever they want that doesn't control other individuals harmless intentions.
My dads could beat up your dad. That's right fools, we have S U P E R I O R numbers! 
This didnt happen. Funny....but no.
It's the same thing with having two moms, lol.

"Your mom is gay"

Which one???
Why are people trying to make up insults in the comments
My friend was also immune to yo momma jokes because she died of cancer. Ahhh I love progress

Wow. Contrived. Whats wholesome about this? 
I don’t think kids (12 year olds) really care bout people being gay
Source: I was one like 5 years ago
Everybody's got a mom, you just might not know em
And I'm sitting here thinking how my possible bimothered child would feel if someone told em a yo mama joke.
I've got two moms, I was just SSSOOOO vulnerable.
For getting rid of women?
I really don't appreciate this morbid humor.
"your dad gay"

"yes"
As a child of two dads, can confirm.
One of the smart ones will probably come up with a "your dads" joke
Progress.
ur dad lesbian
I can see it. I fucked your dad yesterday. 

U gay brah. 
"Yo' poppa so gay, he got himself a husband!"

Yup, it's doable.
Yo papa or yo birth mama
I don't know, kids are pretty stupid.
Progress more like selfishness. Poor kid
Found the high schooler.
There's no way 12-year-olds could come up with the last two.
Yeah...most of these other answers were severely lacking creativity. Nice work here.
As a lesbian I can assure you my jokes are suitably cringe and pun-laden, I feel like they are honorary Dad-jokes
I wonder if it would be worse to have double the dad jokes your whole childhood, or to go out in the world having never developed an resistance to them?
As the hetero son of two women, I've gotta say I was NOT prepared for the day I started making dad jokes.
I mean, the person I know who makes the most dad jokes is my 23 year-old female friend who has no kids.  Even if you don't have a dad, you can't escape them.
Yo momma such a whore they legalized gay marriage to help with the population problem.
The bus driver? Albert Einstein
Oh come on, this one isn't even that hard to believe.
r/nothingeverhappens
Got $100% too
C'mon, every twelve year-old I know uses the word immune! 
Was a rolling stone
This just in: 12 year olds capable of coherent thought
My attention whore sense is tingling on this tweet
Because, gay.......welcome to reddit
Why morbid?
"Which one?"
It's 1 am and I just giggled at this like a 10 year old for a solid minute and probably woke my roommate up
no u
*you're
If you had two dads which one got pregnant??
I had three dads named Jim, my older brother had four dads named Jim but then got divorced so he was back down to three and my younger brother had two sets of parents named Jim and Cindy.
You must have a the best barbecues ever.
Ur dad is go gay that he married a dude!
Yo egg donor so fat, she was also a bacon donor!
I think you're in the wrong subreddit, bruh.
???
Whooooaaah, I know right!!??

And to think, all those homophobes out there being so selfless! 

Sharing their views with us all! 

Making sure their children fit in exactly with the status quo instead of informing them that many differences should be respected and celebrated, and that they’re free to choose their beliefs themselves with a solid empathic and logical mindset! 

God bless you! 
Two dads or none? Which is better - two dads who clearly wanted a kid, had to jump through hoops to get him, and gave him a loving home, OR foster homes, a single mom with a drug problem, or being aborted? 

Tell me which option is best to your homophobic right-wing mind, please.
I don't know, man. They're growing up with the internet. I work with kids, and either I was particularly oblivious (genuinely possible) or the internet is giving kids actual answers to shit we wouldn't have understood before blundering through it ourselves, and it's making them weirdly superficially self-aware.
maybe not the second one... but that last one definately could've originated in middle school
Albert Einstein? The bus driver. 
...is immune supposed to be an advanced word? If you dont know the word immune at twelve, you're a bit behind on your education.
My kid was probably using the word by the time he was 5, thanks, in part, to video games. (“Immune to ice attacks”). Kids are smart, generally, given the opportunity.   That said:  r/kidsfallingdown
Yes, because no video game ever had immunity and resistance as effects and attributes. 
I do not like jokes about gays
"yes"
You got sooo many daddies, when you say "ima tell my daddy on you", people say "which one?"


Uh nope.
These people don’t know their memes 
Swingandamiss
Well, I guess the most fitting answer to your question would be that I’m related to one of my dads, and they hired an egg donor and a surrogate.
Wow, you’ve got a real Jimboree of dads going on. 
They are pretty great. One dad can’t cook but the other dad is a *really* good cook.
- Yes
You probably meant 

***DEFINITELY***  

-not *definately*

I think you mean /r/childrenfallingover
I think you need to Google the definition of morbid, mate.
Don't worry, the gay people aren't the butt of the joke.
No u
You a double bastard
No u 
Actually yes. It's part of the joke to spell it wrong. Have a great day :) 
I'm interested in hearing more about your experience having two dads. I'm gay, and my partner and I are considering adopting at some point in the future, but one of the things that we worry about is how our child would be treated by others and what they might think about us as parents by extension. If you don't mind, can you share more about your thoughts and feelings? 
Both!
Yeah, it'd be more morbid if the joke was that this kid will never experience the pleasure of having a mother. ^(oh my dog it hurt so much typing this)
And also with you.
Nailed it.
Solid recovery
I have NEVER heard of that so I doubt it.
well i don't have much experience in this area, but children aren't born knowing how to hate. they're taught. it's not the kids you have to worry about, but rather their parents.
Have your family. NO child has a perfect life without any struggle. You're lucky in that you know beforehand what types of experiences you'll all have to overcome together in regards to having two dads. No one wins and the world doesn't move forward(and it IS moving forward) when people choose to forgo happiness because of fear of not being accepted.
     Absolutely. When I was really young I didn’t really perceive any difference in having two dads. As I started getting older, I obviously realized that there was a difference between my  parents and other people’s parents. It was sort of frustrating when my classmates assumed that I was adopted or that my mom had died or something like that. You know how people get about assumptions. But eventually, and right now when I’m almost 16, I’m proud to have two dads. I have gone to a relatively liberal school so I’ve probably been exempt from some bullying, but I doubt anyone’s child would receive a lot of judgement for having same-sex parents, especially nowadays. I am also gay and male myself, so I don’t know if that in any way disqualifies or alters my perspective. I have a straight brother whose thoughts I could ask for if you’d like. My brother and I have met our surrogate, but we have never met our egg donor. Neither of us have really had the desire to. Not being related to one of my dads has never put any loyalty to my family into question.
     Overall, I’d say we’re a very happy family. We travel a lot, we communicate, and our parents would do anything for us. I hope this advice is helpful to you and your partner. I’ll certainly have to answer these questions myself someday.
What are they going to do when they break their arms?
To the water, the sun, and the holy guacamole’ 

AMEN 🙏
