HMB while I be a human surfboard.

My friends and I used to do something similar when one of our mates worked at a driving range. We did it *behind* the buggy though - because we were smart about our stupidity. 
It's all good, until you hit that bit of flint the lawnmower shattered.
Much funnier to watch the gif with the top half cut off, so you can't see the beer.
That's the hard way to find the sprinkler heads.
That looks dangerous.
Until you find a pothole and end up in a wheelchair ♿ 
He'll never get those grass stains out. 
Mom brain got me thinking “How is he gonna get the grass stains out of that shirt?”  🤔 
You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like. 
And this is why women outlive men.
Good way to break your neck. 🤦🏼‍♂️
This golf course has everything... Human surfboards
And all of a sudden he slides over a shard of glass sticking out of the grass.
I’ve seen this many times, but it will always get my upvote.
I hope that’s not his favorite shirt. 
r/whitepeoplegifs
This should be a Tide commercial
Not related but I'm curious bc im not native is there any difference between using be and am in this context, does one sound better than the other because of the context or what?
Weekend here I come!
/r/maybemaybemaybe
These water boarding techniques are getting out of hand
And the world never drank beer the same way again.
I was expecting a r/whatcouldgowrong seeing the dude being run over and then eat his buddy’s butt
How do his pants not come off?
Ya all fun and games until that broken bit of tee goes straight up your ass. 
Come on sprinkler head. Where you at?
/r/whitepeoplegifs
What I imagine my husband is doing when he says he’s going to play golf. 
That's a weird fetish. 
Yo we heard you like boarding, so we gonna beerboard you while we surf board you
His ass is grass
“This is a Tide Ad”
Water boarding is out of control these days. 
r/whitepeoplegifs
And then he is disemboweled  
Every aspect of this is legendary 
Sure hope he don't catch a sprinkler head
DRINK PLEDGE.
There is the corect way, and the american way... 
One rock and that guys gonna split open like a Ziploc bag. 
I am guessing they are drinking michelob ultra by the colors. But it is hard to tell
Dip shits!!! Sprinkler heads!!!!!
So is he on a skateboard or something? That sounds like the smart way to do this without pulling your collar across your... I don't know actually. Thyroid? Let's just say neck.
What bet did he lose?!
Looks like Fat Tire
It’s a tide ad
This would be a much different meme if his pegs kicked up and the cart kept going forward.
oh thx i already have soundtrack for this 

[https://coub.com/view/16qs9o](https://coub.com/view/16qs9o)
That’s the new way of waterboarding
Ow?
Even on vacation the prisoners are paraded out for waterboarding. That's some real dedication to your job right there.
How fucking drunk to you have to be for this to happen?
but... why? 


What a legend 
"I have an idea!"

"Fine...  Just make it worth my while."
This looks like a form of torture.

I remember getting in trouble for coming up behind and jumping onto my parents moving golf cart unexpectedly, and this dumb fuck lays down in front of one?
Golfers are depraved and disgusting. 
Uh, mind if we play through?
::::MACKSIMUM WHITENESS::::
This scares the shit out of me. Imagine they hit divot and his head gets stuck but his body keeps going forward.
And there are people who say golf is boring...
Holy grass stains, Batman. 
Oh yeah, playing golf is boring 😒
r/whitepeoplegifs
r/whitepeoplegifs
y tho
Avoiding these guys is why people are willing to pay crazy prices at upscale golf courses. 
Anyone else see that mouse cursor that flies off the screen but only sometimes?
I've watched too many WPD content and I feel like I'm having anxiety thinking if his head caught a small ditch, he'll be pancaked in no time by the buggy
As a former golf course employee, all I can think about is how pissed off the superintendent would be if he saw that shit. Hell hath no fury...
One error and this ends up in /r/whatcouldgowrong
Fucking tide commercials are getting crazy 
Gonna be tough to get out those grass stains.
That would suck if there was a bump or rut in the ground.
> while I be a human surfboard

while I **become*** a human surfboard

/r/titlegore 

Words!   How do they work?!
This is why voting should not be a right
2018 folks.
Showed this to my wife. All she could say was: "who is going to wash out the grass stains".
Tide Detergent should hire this guy and footage for an ad.
The ultimate power bottom.
They just wasted a whole Busch beer

>	we were smart about our stupidity

True words of wisdom.
I do drugs in a similar manner, responsibly irresponsible. 
#We were smart about out stupidity

Smart Stupidity
Nice band name 
This is awfully similar to the old super troopers quote "I invented this gag, Rabbit! Only in my day, the rookie got naked *fires shot and knocks the window out the cruiser* and we also used blanks, you're a sick mother fucker, Mac. 
“I invented this gag rabbit but in my day the rookie got naked...and we also used blanks. You're a sick motherfucker Mack.” 👮🏻‍♂️
Don't put your head out front, because... Well, brain damage. Don't be out front, because of you get caught on something for that split second the driver is not paying attention, injuries all around. Also, facing that way, if something catches your pants, it's cocks out for you.
Idk, I trust this flip flop wearing cart driver in this gif
Someone dumb about his wealth give this man one coin
It runs on bud light 
Safety first
I know have you RES tagged as “Smart about his stupidity”. 
But adrenaline makes you so much stronger! Risk of getting run over would make this much easier for me. Plus I love adrenaline. 
oof, that was an unneeded mental image. thanks mate!
Or those sprinkler heads
I'm guessing that's sharp. 
I cringed 
I scrolled the page down so the top half was cut off and 10/10 would recommend
Only a child under the age of 13 would find that amusing. 

Edit: Well I'll be damned, apparently u/magmorphius is out of high school. If these are the kind of people using reddit then I no longer claim myself a redditor.
Fuckkkk I didn't even think about.
As long as nothing unexpected happens, why even worry?
I've seen the full gif before and yes, red shirt dude does get run over.
That's because it is!
It’s a Tide Ad. 
Mom?
Billy Mays here with oxiclean!
I'm not even a mom and I thought this xD
This and our stubborness.
To shreds, you say. 
As opposed to?
Maybe it’s a tide ad
If that's a tide commercial, and they get *that* stain out, they are worth every penny.
It may be intentional, though. That's one of the crappy things about languages - intentionally breaking rules can hold different meanings and nuances. 

"While I be" is certainly wrong according to English teachers, but also might make you sound more like a caricature of a pirate. Or, it could be trying to evoke "meme-speak." Or, it could be trying to highlight the stupidity of the action.
It’s not the “proper” way to speak, but it’s how everyone speaks if you know what I mean. It’s like “I ain’t doing nothing wrong” it’s incorrect but it’s a part of common speech. If you said “hold my beer while I be a human surfboard” no one would correct you and say it sounded unnatural except the most pretentious English teachers/students

Proper speech is most likely become, I agree with the poster above
The title is wrong. It could be am but even that’s a little weird, best option would be become. 
Beer! 
Same but hopefully more than me.

I once was high but at that point where its hard to tell if you are really really high and can't take anymore or will have the most epic high with a bit more. 

I was alone so I entered 911 in on my phone, put it beside me and proceeded to take more. My logic was if I started to OD it was just one button and I lived pretty close to the hospital lol.

Welcome to reddit. The group think is strong and isn’t old enough to drive. 
Lol fuck off you literal waste of space. Gatekeeper of what is funny. Go play in traffic. 
I don't understand the purpose of these troll accounts. Serious question: Why do you just want to talk shit about everything and collect downvotes? 
Sprinkler heads do t stick out of the ground on a golf course.  They're larger and typically under a recessed metal enclosure.  You'd skip right over them and probably whack your tailbone.
There are unknown unknowns out there. 
Unexpected like finding sprinklers in a golf course
Smash cut to the 2008 Financial Crisis.
I'm mad that this doesn't have more upvotes.
Nah, now it's that dookie butter guy from the pushover plunge infomercials.

Didn't that one golfer during the Masters sprain his ankle by stepping on a sprinkler head after celebrating a hole in one?
me too thanks
There are known knowns in here.
It is known.
To shreds, you say?

Not so fast; you only need a Sunday afternoon and a blender, to get closer.
You just need to wait for Brad-Corp to get large enough to rationalize a personal hygiene arm of the company!
Ah yes, the r/iamverysmart starter kit
LOL I thought that was the assholes response and I was like no fucking way he thought that was an acceptable response haha
Don't hate on classical music though
I’m a child who is 15 and I find it amusing. 
Bravo 
Great now I’m sad 
Got eeeeeem
Hahah I did too for a second.  I was hella ready to screenshot for /r/iamverysmart
I'm not hating on any of the things. I'm ripping on people who think having different taste makes them superior.

That's a pretty mild opiate war story, but cheer up, it doesn't always end bad. I've got 2.5 years clean. However I'm once again a stoner with a dead end job. So, yeah. Don't do percs.
Oh, very good point
