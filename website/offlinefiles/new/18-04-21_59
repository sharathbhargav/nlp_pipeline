Cleaning for electricity

Oh my god. It's literally washing something that provides power. It's power *washing*.
You know he can do that fast as fuck.  He is just training others , obviously 
I’d like to see the finished product 
THE BRUSH/SQUEEGEE COMBO <3
Where is this?
I was ready to watch every panel be washed.
If I was nearby i’d break in to clean these. I have that pole.
By the time he's done doing all of those the sun will have set.
They should just put these inside to keep them from getting dirty, why would you leave your expensive solar panels outside?

My first thought was “Oh no don’t brush the dirt around! You’ll make tiny scratchies!”
r/mildlyinfuriating
Please tell me you have a video for after... 😅😅
Why not just use a hose ?
That's a reach and wash pole. The water he's using is deionized water. 
It leaves the panel streak and blemish free as it dries.

I know this because I have a shitty job.
There's got to be some automated way to do this. Sprinkler system or something. 
Was this after some sort of dust storm??
It bugs me for some reason that he swipes up over the dry dust (even though the broom is wet) because it seems like there’s more potential to scratch. I know little about solar panels and I’m sure I’m over anal about it 
The real question is why they let them get so dirty before washing them. They obviously don't need or use those panels much.
That's like the Hitachi equivalent for this sub and shit.
So how much do I have to pay to do this all day for the rest of my life?
This needs a NSFW tag op. 
Clean electricity :D

Where does one apply for such a fulfilling job? (I would love this seriously)
My high school teacher started NOMMADD. Guys should check it out 
I’m sure there is going to be an entire new industry that will pop up to automate cleaning and maintenance for solar panels
It really bothers me that he starts at the bottom. I’m sure there is a reason, but I don’t like it. 
I wonder if this could be automated. 
That’s so satisfying. Have an upvote. 
There must be a more efficient way to do this, right? Feels like something to look into. For example using less water and doing it faster, for huge Solar fields I mean, and whatever else there is to be improved. 
Where can i buy one of this?
why does that machine look so clumsy?
robot job is there ever was one; they could be powered by contacts on the panel and left on the panel to clean constantly.
This is the worst fucking clip I've seen on this sub
r/specializedtools ? i’ve never seen one of these and can’t imagine it being used for much else lol
Gets all the way down to the end, comes back on the bottom row... ends up at starting point and begins the cycle again --- perpetual power ^washing achieved.
That very secure looking wall has a giant hole in it. 
Those are 6x10 330W CanSolar panels, the kind you can't get in the US anymore because of the 30% tariff. 
How does it get that dirty before you clean it? Especially at a place that really needs those to be clean.
If this is power washing porn I’ve got some blue fucking balls. Cut the first 35 seconds of that and speed the rest up
I found a longer version/source.

Wouldn water amplify the sun's rays, providing more power?
If someone is paid to clean the solar panels, they are being paid by the panels they clean. It is like the human is their servant.
Sometimes I wonder how we got to a place in life where we have to have an automatic rinse/squeegee contraption to clean a solar panel that is six feet away from you.

A hose and a non-abrasive cloth does the exact same thing in a fraction of the time at a fraction of the cost.
I always find the links to reddit take forever to load, so I just skip them.
Clean energy!
Mind blown. You've just earned yourself and OP an upvote.

Can I see a professional?
I hope so, otherwise he is going to be there a very long time.
This is the only kind of porn that I would watch the entire thing leading up to the finish. 

Edit: I tend to skip

HELIOS One in the Mojave.
I was wondering the same thing. I was thinking it could be west Africa during the Winter months when the sand from the Sahara desert blows over and covers everything in dust. 
Pretty sure it’s the Bronx. 
Somewhere in India...
Mars
Me too. Is there a word for wanting to see something get finished? Completionist?
Window cleaner? 
By the time he’s done doing all of those the first ones will be dirty again.
It will probably take like less than 2 mins per panel. With breaks doing the whole thing will take around 2-3 hours at most.
They should put them in a glass house, problem solved, no dust on the panels.
Yeah, really odd to me that they don't start by spraying EVERYTHING  down with water first and then gentle brushing to loosen the last bits, and then squeegee...
Me too. Looks like he started with the right idea, let the water do most of the work. Then he went up against gravity on the second half and I'm like, "noooooo!"
Looks lime they need a pressure washer 
Yeah I was wondering if this scratches it?
I'm guessing you need to squeegee it dry or the water would just attract new dust more quickly until it evaporates.
Probably no infrastructure or they don't want to use that much water
You mean like this? 

https://youtu.be/3b2bnYbkxq0
Yeah like cars have. A little nozzle on each panel to squirt windex and then a wiper blade.
1st World tool requiring 1st World infrastructure and supply chains.

In developing countries you want solutions that fits the local circumstances .  

**Usually** that means substituting more labor for energy+machines and making the machines you do use locally source-able and human maintainable.  That pretty much rules out fancy labor-saving which you really don't want because giving people jobs is more critical to the local economy that destroying jobs.

This is how the US obsession with efficiency doesn't actually play well and can actually be the very worst possible instinct to use for problem solving.
Maybe not, dust and mud tends to settle on anything that doesn't move. 
Either that or just seasonal cleaning. 
Could’ve happened overnight: dust storm, etc 
/r/Showerthoughts 
Seriously. Unless that dust is caked on, which it doesn't appear to be, then just get a regular hose gun and cut your cleaning time by 90%.
Righttttt
I haven't heard that name in years.

Actually it's on reddit
I have a theoretical degree in physics.
I was about to say that. Take your updoot 
You just blew my damn mind. I’ve lived in Nigeria all my life and never thought to think of it as “winter” months. We always call that time period Harmattan. However, it does get colder in the early hours of the morning and at night which often leads to people wearing warmer clothing. 

Lord have mercy, we actually have our own Winter...

P.S It’s kinda strange but I love the smell of the air during Harmattan. It’s basically just dust but there’s something about it. Makes cleaning a bitch though, dust gets *everywhere.*
And that dust blows across the Atlantic, and falls in part in the Amazon basin to provide some of the soil there.

No thanks, not thirsty. 
No, powerwash fetishist.
That’s smart. Job security. /s
I wonder how much of an issue their water supply is. Like, maybe it’s just a single tank that they’ve got if it’s a long ways away from a source of running water
Tons of water is dripping off anyways, and it clearly doesn't need to be swept to be cleaned.   Not to mention, the water is hooked up to the machine so it can be similar used as a hose fairly easily.
Well there you go, but how do we keep the robot clean?

Uhhh, not really, it's a great instinct, and it's done very well for global standards of living.

If the robot costs more than local man hours, it's cheaper to have human labor take care of the issue, but the more local labor increases in cost, the more likely it is that the efficiency driven model will take over.

The high efficiency approach reduces the total number of jobs, and then the cost of labor drops, which is good, because then other problems that don't have easily automated problems can still afford labor while the total productivity goes up.

Having no efficiency driven systems would mean a huge hit to the productivity and as a direct result, the standard of living in a country.

I feel like this logic breaks down when you're talking about outsourcing in the process of reducing labor costs if it comes with a decrease in quality, and it almost always does. That's more of a phenomenon of liquidizing a company, and less about actual efficiency.
Yup! I live in Phoenix. My car will get like this overnight. This hasn't ever happened over the span of a few days. All it takes is some rain and a dust storm right after. It doesn't happen with just rain or just dust. 
You can tell by the way that it is
"Fuck, man. Everything. I push buttons. I turn dials. I read numbers. Sometimes I make up little stories in my head about what the numbers mean."
Hahah. That really interesting! So I use to live in Nigeria and we would leave for part of the winter months and that's when Harmattan would start. I remember when I would came back everything would be crazy dusty, but the sky was incredible.. But when I was writing that comment I was trying to remember how to spell (Harmattan) and I had no clue, so thank you. 
Nice
I'm not defending this set up, it seems like there is a lot wrong with it, but it's definitely capable of using less water than just "spraying them clean" with a hose or a pressure washer.

Seems like what would be more efficient would be to mist/lightly spray them with something that helped break down the dust layer, and then a gentle single motion brush/squeegee action to clean and dry with one swipe. The brush stroke up makes little sense to me, and the water being dispensed where it is, is also odd.

Maybe if the water misted in an arc in front of the bristles, in the pole direction of the set up, you could get it all at once and pretty fast, otherwise it would probably be easier to have the water spray from a totally different set up, and just have a brush/squeegee to clean up after the spray. 

At least in this video, it seems very awkward.
That’s pretty neat!
