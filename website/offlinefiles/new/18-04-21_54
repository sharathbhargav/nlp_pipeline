Edit: created a five minute piece of art for you all.
yeah, like any of you have any friends that will ask you to go out with them
California screaming is the ride in the photo and the max height is 120 ft
When you trick your brain into thinking that adrenalin is serotonin.
my life is the rollercoaster, and if I could i would said no, but it seems I haven't any control about it.
I took my wife on the Giant Dipper roller coaster on our second date in Santa Cruz twenty years ago. Come to find out later that she hates roller coasters and hasn't been on one since.
And she's just about to Puke
feelsgoodman
So this is what Meghan Trainor is up to
She has a song NO tho
I went to Cedar Point with my friends and thy dragged me on Millennium Force, which is one of the taller roller coasters out there. Before that, I refused to go on them. They basically convinced me to go on it and by the time I wanted to change my mind, the ride had started. I’m sobbing as the train starts to go up the massive hill and people are questioning if I’m alright. 

I love roller coasters now. That first ride was a baptism by fire. I still have to close my eyes while the ride slowly ascends though. 
Isn't that Meghan Trainor? She pretty much knows how to say No, at least based on her song No.
As someone who is afraid of heights, this is me but with my eyes closed.
And like me... In the fucking first row of seats. 
Currently tried to go on a date to a concert, tinder looked nothing like her and I spent $80 on a concert we didn’t even make. Still stuck at her house since I couldn’t drive, this is 100 percent meirl.
She's thinking about how much fun she's going to have when she rips her hair out because it's caught inbetween her shoulder and headguard.
She literally has a song called 'No'
Is that the all about that bass girl?
I know someone who ended up actually skydiving this way.  They threw up afterwards
I hate roller coasters I’m afraid of heights. I had to go with my youth group and I didn’t want to seem like a pussy in front of everyone since they were all cheering me on. I got on the Superman ride which shoots up and down really fast. I just remember shaking for over an hour after the ride lol. Adrenaline is a bitch 
Can' relate. I know how to say no. That's why people hate me, because I don't do what they want me to do.
Going to help my friend film one of those mirror-phone drop videos on Sunday. Why the fuck did i agree to that
Thanks but no thanks

Nobody ever said I leave my house
This is me right now at the amusement park. Damnit!
This is fine.
My heart just dropped
pooop.
i would love to go a theme park
Megan needs a trainer
I wish someone invited me to an amusement park. 
Only rollercoaster I’m going on is [this one] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia_Coaster)
She looks like season 1 Leslie from Parks and Recreation
This is the most I've related to ~~a post on this sub~~ ~~a post on reddit~~ anything.
Basically me whenever my family asks me if I want to go out for dinner
Looks just like an ex of mine. 
I've been there. It was terrifying but I don't regret it cause now I can say that I've been on that thing.
Too bad that’s California Screamin’ at Disney California Adventure, which only goes up 120ft in the air
and you're fat and ugly
[deleted]
Wanna go get pizza and a beer some time?
>r/absolutelynotmeirl

*>not saying no*
Her name is No
Who actually has a song called “No” so this post kind of doesn’t even work 
[Apparently so](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/321374123395242022/)
That's No. 
Yeah her name is no
Gawd she's hideous
ARE YOU ENTERTAINED?
2Meta4Me
No, but I do have a mum who hates me.
Oof
Parents.
I did until I figured out ways to say no , now they don’t ask and we all happy 
That's still 115 feet too high.
Now how the hell can you just tell it’s screamin?
Found the enthusiest
This guy roller coasters!!!!!!!
So she rode it three times, thats over 300
Went on that before it wasn't bad
I couldn't figure out for the life of me that it was. Did CA Screamin really have that bad of restraints? Those trains remind me of boxy B&M wooden ones
Best Coaster I've ever ridden. The lift is actually quite fast compared to most thanks to the [cable system](https://coasterpedia.net/wiki/Cable_lift)!
Are you guys in middleschool?
**Euthanasia Coaster**

The Euthanasia Coaster is an art concept for a steel roller coaster designed to kill its passengers. In 2010, it was designed and made into a scale model by Julijonas Urbonas, a PhD candidate at the Royal College of Art in London. Urbonas, who has worked at an amusement park, stated that the goal of his concept roller coaster is to take lives "with elegance and euphoria". As for practical applications of his design, Urbonas mentioned "euthanasia" or "execution".

/r/nowabsolutelymeirl
No I...I can't...I already...yeah, sure let's go. 
Yes
Genetic excuse
That depends, do we have to talk to each other?
no... because of the implication.
No Trainor?  Good call on the name change. 
I'm sorry I can't say her name 
Oh I just thought it made it a lil ironic 
Yep, just have a rich daddy to make it so far
she would if she took the time or energy to spare you a thought 
Owie
[The design on the ride car, mainly the yellow stripes on the red car](https://imgur.com/gallery/9hOuece)  and the restraints, which don’t fit the mold of the typical Intamin OTS restraint. 

If you think this is black magic, check out /r/guessthecoaster. They are able to name rides from all around the world, from very minor clues. There was a guy who recognized something off of only a single support once
Yes I do. 170 credits and counting
/r/theydidthemonstermath
I haven’t ridden it since I was a kid, before I was experienced enough to be a snob, so I don’t know
What, down syndrome?
Traino
You're thinking of Alanis
You know she was a song writer before a singer, right? She wrote for Rihanna. 
Savage meet burned.
Ouch
