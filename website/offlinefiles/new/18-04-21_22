I told myself I‚Äôd wait a few years now that I‚Äôm out on my own to get a dog... I lasted a week, adopted this good boy yesterday!

I fully support this decision 
What‚Äôs his name?? He‚Äôs so handsome üòç
You won‚Äôt regret it.  

Adopting my boy was the best decision I ever made! üíñüê∂üíñ
Kudos for adopting! He's a cutie.
I've seriously been thinking about getting a dog, but I don't know how regular 9-5ers do it. I'm now at a place where I can work from home for a few days a week, but the other days I'm gone for at least 10 hours. 

How do people do it? I'd just feel horrible leaving him/her all alone for that long. 

Anyone have some tips?

He's a cutie, BTW, OP :P

Wow! He is so cute. What is a rot mix?
He Def. looks like a Theodore.
Now that you have him, it‚Äôs a true home! And look at that cute blop!! 
hello, my frens - i Lucky dog, cuz someone picked me out  
dey thought i'd make the Bestess pet, n That i have No doubt!  
for a ver long time i watched n waited at that Other place  
for a hooman fren to come along - n den i saw her face

she looked at me n smiled, n i wagged my tail right back  
'please Please pick Me!' i wished so hard - we Both felt the attrac  
n so she brought me here, dis place - she calls her very own  
now we'll spend our lives Together, n  we'll Never be alone :)
Yay for adoption... how old is he 
Can you hug him for me?
I just did the same thing. Life is too short, dogs make you happy. Congratulations to you!
Beautiful pooch OP!  Don't sweat the haters above too much, they are just jealous they didn't get him :\)  

But do keep in mind that you will have the occasional unexpected vet expense of $100\+ to keep him happy and healthy.  Regular vet visits usually cost about that \(sometimes more depending on shots/tests\).  Other than that, it's just food \(don't get the cheapest stuff, go upper\-mid grade\), water, love, attention \(belly scritches\), and lots of potty breaks.  Good luck OP, you got a keeper!  He looks just like [our Bessie \(left\) did a few years ago, and she is great!](https://imgur.com/gallery/B3PiTSM)  

Also, if you ever need a "cover" breed \(can't get apt because of rottweiler/shepherd mix, etc\), just tell people he's got a lot of [Hovawart in him.](https://www.google.com/search?q=hovawart&client=opera&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8_u-p1svaAhVh6IMKHVVLAYAQ_AUICigB&biw=1920&bih=970)   They can look it up if so inclined and the scruffy head can make it convincing haha
Cute dog) Be nice with him)
Eyebrows

This looks like the kind of floofer that will love you forever. Got goodboye writing all over that happy face! 

I hope you have a long, healthy, happy life with him! üíï
I totally see Berner on this boy!!  Gorgeous and  congratulations! I have a Bernese Mountain Dog such a great dog!! 
I really want to get a dog since our family dog died a few years ago. I'm moved out now and work, I'm wondering how everyone else is managing a dog whilst living alone? Is it okay to leave dogs alone for some of the day? I'm jealous 
He‚Äôs so cute! Hope you guys have a good life together :) 
Boop boop boop kiss! 
That is a fantastic looking dog
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Very happy for you both! 
I also adopted a rottie/golden/whatever mix as an adult dog and he is the BEST. Well, he's nearly impossible to teach leash etiquette to. But it's getting better. But he is such a sweetheart.

Congrats on your new BFF. 
Just put my dog asleep on Thursday... cherish that dog every single fucking day.
He's a handsome boy!
Fantastic decision! Wishing you many years full of love and great health together!
That‚Äôs one heckin‚Äô good boy right there!
Good looking pup OP
Congrats on the new family member. You can see the personality in his face! I find they reveal their names to you. Strangely mine come in dreams. 
Good job not immediately wanting to only get a puppy. Hopefully you are actually ready physically, financially, and emotionally to care for a dog! Usually not a good idea to do something like this on impulse
BEAUTIOUS!! CONGRATS! 
A few questions for my curiosity. What his name? How big is he? How old? Suspected breed? I love dogs and I‚Äôll always adopt, always curious about new dog parents!!
Aww :D congratulations! He looks as stoked as you sound 
Same thing happened to me. My partner and I talked about waiting a few months to get a dog after we moved in together. 2 weeks after we moved in he took me to the shelter to adopt a dog for my birthday. 
Aww what a prince üòò
I love Rottweilers and any dog that look like them! Please give him a chin scratch for me!
I lasted 6 months.. and they were the saddest 6 months of my life I couldn‚Äôt live without a companion congratulations he looks so happy 
I'm sure he'll love spending all day alone waiting for you to come home!!
WOW! That‚Äôs a good boy.
Please give him a good boy pet for me. He looks like such a sweet boy
r/dogblep
Congrats on the pupper! He will bring more joy and happiness into your life than you can imagine!
Who else saw this pic and said, "Who's a good booyyy?" out loud?
Take good care! :D
I lasted three weeks when my last buddy passed away. Probably wasn't my best decision from a grieving standpoint, but - being in Any house without a dog is weird and lonely. Congrats on the puppers! He's a cutie! 
Jeeze he's a pretty dog. Good for you!
You can tell. He‚Äôs a good boy. 
You waited a week. In dog, that's forever.
I mean, how could you not? Give him a good scratch for me!
Been thinking to adopt one since quite some time. How do you intend to manage your schedule with your dog?
Looks like a Hovawart breed to me.
[Oh.  My.  Dawg.](https://youtu.be/1SI6rhotAkE) That is a cuddlebug if I've ever seen one.  
That dog is gorgeous! Looks like there's some Rottweiler in that precious pup.
But...what if I need to hug him?
Do you know what he‚Äôs mixed with?
As adorable as he is, I think you made a mistake. You would have become a more put together, and confident person had you waited and lived alone for a little while. I hope for your sake you don‚Äôt become dependent on your new pup for security and happiness. 
Who's a good boy?
blep
Your dog looks amazing, congratulations for adopting such a fine-looking dog.
He's adorable!  Any idea on the breed?
Looks similar to ours (but with longer hair)! We ended up calling ours Theodore/Teddy :) We thought he was a bernese/rott mix as well. For fun, we ran a DNA test on him through http://embarkvet.com -- we were waaay off. Turned out he was 50% German Shepherd, 20% American Pitbull Terrier, and a bunch of other crazy stuff (10% dalmation, 10% chow, etc.)
I did the same thing. I was going to wait to get a cat and I had her before I'd even spent a night alone in my apartment. 
He‚Äôs a good boye
Looks just like my pupper. We think he is an Rottie/ Australian Shepherd mix

Looks like one of the goodest of boys! 
Who's a good BOI? You are!!! Such handsome fluff:)
Quality blop from a quality boye
Mlep 
How come when I go to dog shelters to adopt a lot of dogs don‚Äôt look like this. I feel bad not adopting one of them, but I just want a type of dog that‚Äôs rarely carried.
Good call!
You mean the impulse decision to get a pet, before OP has even had the time to figure out how well they can afford to support themselves, let alone pets? Pets should never be impulse decisions, this dog will probably end up back in a shelter in another weeks' time once OP realizes how much money and effort dog ownership takes...

Edit: Granted, I don't know OP's financial situation, but the phrasing in the title sure makes it sound like they don't know either. Like I said, living on your own for less than a week isn't enough to determine that. So unless they are filthy rich and don't need to worry about money *at all*, I still maintain they should've at least waited several months to see how much money they have left after paying rent and utilities... because again, a week isn't long enough to figure that shit out.
I‚Äôm thinking Bear right now, I‚Äôve never had such a hard time picking a name though! 
I absolutely agree!!! Making the same decision for my life has been The Best descison i could ever possibly make. 
Depending on how much money she makes. Dogs, especially large ones, need a lot of food, which can get really expensive if you don't want to feed them crap. Also they'll become pests if you don't walk them regularly.
Wouldn‚Äôt trade that roommate for anything 
Your best bet is an adult or older dog. Look for one who is used to that life style (ie the owner died, family moved, baby had an allergy/etc)  and talk honestly about the situation to the rescue or shelter volunteers. 

Also, looks into budgeting for a day or more a week in daycare. Even if just one day, a full day of daycare while you're gone 10 hours will tire a dog out and they likely won't mind the peace and quiet of being left alone for a few days after the daycare fun.
I sometimes go very long hours for school. This is usually fine when it happens as I have a roommate, but she often works 12 hour shifts that line up with me being at school for 10-12 hours sometimes. On a normal day I'm at school for at least 8. I've never had a puppy so that's a big thing, and one of my dogs can easily snooze for 10-12 hours (although I really don't like him too). 

Whenever I'n gone like that, I honestly just call a friend to come let them out halfway through the day. If a friend can't do it, I happily pay a neighbour or someone else to do it. It doesn't happen too often (I'm lucky), so the money doesn't add up too much. If I'm gone 10 hours I usually don't, but if I come home to an accident, especially from my newer dog, I just think of it as part of owning a dog. 
I train my dogs to use pee pads while I'm not home. If you don't mind having them around. And I have a camera that I watch them from sometimes and they just sleep all day. Even when I only had the one she was fine all day home alone. 

My newer one does have a habit of chewing something  (card board,bag of treats, bananas) up occasionally and I'm working on breaking that habit but otherwise she's fine.

I do walk them a lot though. 45 minutes after work and usually another 25 minute walk before bed. And on the weekends at least 2 hours of walking a day but usually more.
The shelter‚Äôs paperwork calls him a Bernese Mountain Dog/Golden Retriever mix and my apartment has breed restrictions so I‚Äôm going with that üòâ
Looks like Rottweiler and Gordon Setter. 
That was one I was considering actually!
He was a stray but the shelter‚Äôs best guess is three!
He would love that, I will get on that asap.
Definitely okay! A lot of dogs sleep all day! I‚Äôm planning to bring him to daycare once a week for a bit but that‚Äôs more to help him learn socialization and in case I have to board him! 
I am so sorry. I know it is heartbreak. 
I‚Äôve been seriously considering it for months, I have a nice chunk of savings, I‚Äôm working a slightly less than full time job and can continue to do so for the first few months if need be so help him adjust. I also did not want a puppy because they are a lot of work I do not want to do, nice adult dog to take on walks and to training is the kind of work I want to put in.
I‚Äôm thinking Bear for his name atm, he is a little over 80lbs, three years old and the shelter has him down as a golden Bernese mix
The shelter said Bernese Mountain Dog and Golden
I mean, dog shelters don‚Äôt really ‚Äúcarry‚Äù dogs. 
They're not a line of purses or shoes that gets carried by a store. They're living things. Considering them as objects is an indicator that you probably shouldn't own one
Agreed but I‚Äôm sure OP is aware of their finances!! I know many people in college rn who have dogs and I‚Äôve been waiting until I graduate and settled into a job. If that‚Äôs a week or so after moving in, why the heck not! Especially since I‚Äôm personally choosing my place of residence after grad to fit a doggo. Ya never know. Definitely need to be stable to get a pet, no doubt! 
While vet visits can get pricey sometimes, dog ownership isn't \*that\* expensive.  Heck, I've spent more money on supplies  for my two fish in the last 6 months than I have on my two dogs, and all of my animals are happy and healthy as hell. 

Chill out and be happy that this beautiful boy isn't going to be killed in a week now.  Or would lethal injection be preferable to him being adopted by a young adult whom is just starting out on the adventure of their life, in your eyes?
It was an impulse decision when I adopted my dog in 2009. He‚Äôs now 9 years old and I can‚Äôt imagine my life without him. 
You have no idea what the circumstances are
Huh so if two years ago I told myself I wanted to go to Japan, and then in those last two years I saved up to have vacation days as well as some spending money and took some time to learn enough Japanese to basically live there, it would still be an impulse trip if I flew out yesterday, right?
You what they say about assuming!? Oh wait, you‚Äôre just an ass. 
You really shouldn't be down voted..... Pets are alot more work and more expensive than you think. I also learned the hard way even though I grew up with family dogs. Soon after I got my first place my dog started having bad seizures. that unexpected bill of 60 dollars a month for his meds fucked me up bad when I was just getting started
Why is this person getting downvotes? We don‚Äôt even know how big OPs yard is. He probably lives in an apartment. 
Ninjaaaaa it must take a toll going around life thinking the way you do. To be honest I kinda pity and feel sorry for you. I hope one day can see joy.
Lol unless you can‚Äôt afford to even pay rent, dogs are not that expensive. Love the hyperbole in this comment. So dramatic 
Go back to tumblr. 
Lol same thought here. Do you work in the veterinary industry as well?
He looks like a Bear!
That‚Äôs crazy because I know a family that has two Bernese Mountain dogs called Bear & Moose. They suit their names so much!
Call him Tony
My first dog's name was Bear. 10/10 name him Bear.
Have you considered Boaty McBoatFace?
My Spanish grandma had a similar dog called Oso (bear in spanish in case you didn't know!). Always thought it was the perfect name for him
I love the name Bear!
My dog is named Yogi. I call him Yogi bear a lot. Gotta get another named BooBoo haha.
As somebody with a Bear, I support this decision. (https://i.imgur.com/dWjnwzN.jpg)
Bjorn 
Make a decision, fast. I never managed to do so for my dog and I just started calling him woof out of desperation. 7 years later, I still get weird looks when I start yelling out WOOF while walking my dog. 
When we adopted our cats, we took a week or so to settle on a name. Good to come up with one (or a few) that you like, and see what seems to fit their personality. Enjoy your new companion!!!
I like Bear! Also, maybe consider Teddy or Theodore for long. Idk but I like fancy names for dogs and he‚Äôs just so majestic. 
Bear'Klaw is the only answer
Brody 
Looks like a Benson to me
Stick with Bear. 
Bear is his name. 
Thanks so much for the advice! After looking it up, I could afford a day or two of daycare. And holy crap‚Äîthere's one 2 blocks from my work! 

Thanks again for the advice! 
That‚Äôs exactly why I wasn‚Äôt looking at puppies! I also plan to get him in day care once a week or so for the first month or two. I worked at one and they are great for socialization and to keep them busy, most dogs also don‚Äôt want to be there everyday so budgeting for five days a week isn‚Äôt necessary at all too! A lot of dogs that went every day would sleep all day and get super crabby. 
That dog is 100% Rottweiler mix. Ive grown up with rotties my whole life and i recognize them instantly. Maybe a rottie golden mix, but i don‚Äôt see any bernise mountain dog. I said my pure bred rottie was a lab mix when i was living in apartments. Worked every time since they never checked and nobody reported me
He looks super sweet!!
Go with that. Purebred rottweilers do come in longhaired, it's a recessive gene. 
>my apartment has breed restrictions 


Sounds like a job for Barkin Luther King. End doggo housing discrimination now!
Edited: I gave horrible advice that could be devastating to people in need of help. This was not my intention but please, downvote away.

All hail Theodore!!
What a good boy 
The time and energy may be more important than the financial aspect. Especially with young pets that are returned when people realize how much attention they require. 

I agree with the massively downvoted guy that a major life decision like getting a dog shouldn‚Äôt be impulsive for the sake of both parties. 
Some people just love to be condescending any chance they get. Especially about pets, I‚Äôve met a few people who‚Äôs entire life were about pets and they would constantly talk shit and make assumptions about how other people care for their pets and talk down to them about how to properly do anything pet related like they are some mastermind and everyone else is just inept.

Lots of these people I‚Äôve experienced value pets lives over human lives, and while I get the edginess in saying you care for dogs more than humans, it‚Äôs a pretty seriously fucked up way of thinking. Like ‚Äúoh all these PETA commercials and Sarah McLachlan songs mean so much to me but I think that guy who was going too fast on the freeway deserves to die!‚Äù
‚ÄúOh my god PETA is testing chemicals (for human use) on mice! Oh the travesty! I wish stupid humans would just suck it up and test on themselves instead of poor little mice! Damn them!‚Äù
Not expensive early on, but my 11 year old main man has cost me $17k in the last year for a life saving stomach surgery with some crazy complications and a torn ACL.

Get pet insurance early folks!!
The circumstances are that OP has lived on their own for less than a week and immediately got a pet. It's in the goddamn title...
While I'm not overly concerned about the dog (I'm sure it'll be ok, there's always a way) if you wanted to go to Japan but not before in a couple of years you surely must have had some logical reason why now wasn't the best time. So if the reason didn't change but you decided to do it anyways it's more Impulse. 
No. But if you planned on going on a trip to Japan in two years and then bought a ticket and flew out a week later (which is the timeframe OP has with his dog) then it would be an impulse trip.
It makes an ass out of u and... ming.
Yes. They should be downvoted. They're making a handful of entirely baseless assumptions about OP's finances and abilities, telling them that they are thoughtless and irresponsible because OP decided they didn't actually have to wait as long as they anticipated to get a dog.
They absolutely should be downvoted. They‚Äôre assuming OP doesn‚Äôt have any clue how to take care of dogs, and that they don‚Äôt have the financial stability to do so, without any evidence. So they‚Äôre shitting on OP by saying they‚Äôll abandon their dog even though they have zero evidence to assume that would be the case. Prime downvote material.
because Reddit has an unhealthy obsession and dependence on dogs
Dog in an apartment with no yard who gets a good amount of walks and exercise vs a shelter. Huh. I dunno what's better! /s 
To be fair, OP definitely said they live in an apartment. 
I live in an apartment with 2 dogs... What exactly is the issue? They get 1-2 hours walking a day, are fit, healthy and happy. 

As for why he is getting downvoted - because he is an ass. 

He is making assumptions and conclusions about a person he knows nothing about. 
Is it an industry consensus that euthanasia is preferable to adoption by a young adult?  At least this one has a chance at living now...
He does ü§ó
He looks a bit more like a dog to me
One of my friend‚Äôs swissies (Swiss Mountain Dogs) was nicknamed ‚Äúmouse‚Äù ... a 130 lbs mouse. 
He looks like a Tony.
Mine too! Miss that big boy. 
Aww! Is your bear an Aussie wiggle butt? 
I think just Theo would be a cute name, too!! üê∂
Wow, you're so lucky if you decide to do this!!
See if the place near your work offers package pricing. Most places in my city offer 10-30 day packages that are discounted by 20% or more. 
I feel like you didn't understand the subtleties of "my apartment has breed restrictions so I‚Äôm going with that üòâ". Or even the overties.  

This person is literally saying the reason they call their dog a bernese mountain dog mix is because their apartment has restrictions on what breeds live there.
I think there is a solid argument for a Bernie there
There's longhaired rotties too super gorgeous
Just bought a pure bred american rotty a week ago, hes 9 weeks now and its the first big dog I've had at such a young age, how long does the biting stages normally last?
If OP actually *needs* an emotional support dog then yes, do this.  Otherwise stop abusing the system and making life more difficult for those who actually benefit from support animals. 
Worst advice ever that hurts those who truly need such help.  
For all intents and purposes aren‚Äôt all dogs technically emotional support? I‚Äôve grown up with dogs and now is the first time I don‚Äôt have one around and I can tell you I certainly would have my emotion uplifted if one were around. 
I agree as well. 
Kinda upset how everyone supported OP's impulse buying decision because "cute doggo." Dogs take a lot of work to take care of. Down votes buried any comment saying otherwise
It's not prime downvoting material at all, posts like this shouldn't be filtered out because you don't agree with them. I don't fully agree with OP but you cannot deny that his post, altough controversial started an important and interesting discussion regarding pet ownership. 

comments like "lol ur gay" "your dog looks stupid""I don't care" are downvote material, they contribute nothing.

Seriously, if you think something is wrong with OP's post, reply, call him out, correct him, don't just downvote.
Do you have evidence that he‚Äôs financially stable then? I don‚Äôt think so.
> They‚Äôre assuming OP doesn‚Äôt have any clue how to take care of dogs, and that they don‚Äôt have the financial stability to do so, without any evidence. 

The evidence is in the title. OP says they've lived on their own for less than a week. That isn't enough time to get your shit together.
Why do people view a content aggregating website as a single one-minded entity?
That‚Äôs like saying people in cities can‚Äôt have dogs.
people can walk their dogs üòÇ
It's not an assumption, when OP says all that I need to hear in the title. Living a week on your own isn't enough to determine whether you can support a pet on top of your own expenses.
BEAR.
At least partially. I‚Äôm not sure what else he‚Äôs mixed with besides fluff!
I think I'm gonna get me a pup! This place is 2 blocks from my work, and $33 a day! Not cheap by any means, but they seem to take care of them to the utmost degree!

Now I just have to go to the shelter and let one of those silly fools choose me!

I can't turn into my mother, though. She has like a rotation of 5-8 dogs at a time because she can't say no. 

I might turn into my mother...


That and the shelter paperwork says he‚Äôs Bernese golden mix. He does have the personality of many Bernese I‚Äôve met though too so I can see him having some Bernese in him regardless.
Actually i understood why they said that, its why i mentioned i called my rottie a lab mix when i was in his same situation. 
Agreed. I have a Berner and that‚Äôs the first thing I thought when I saw this cutie. 
Until ~6 months. Puppy biting is super important so they learn to use their mouth appropriately. Redirect playful biting to toys, and if he's just trying to chew then give him a bully stick or similar natural chew (no rawhide); I also like to give them cardboard as they can sink their teeth into it. If it's crazy biting and he won't focus on a toy and is just going after you and your clothes/shoes, put him in his crate for a nap, they do that when they're overtired. Head over to /r/dogtraining for good tips.
How does getting a a certificate off a website hurt anybody? 
Im truly curious. 
Please explain. This isnt my intention at all. How am i hurting anyone?
My dog IS actually an emotional support animal for reasons i will not post on the internet. 

‚ÄúTechnically‚Äù sure, ‚Äúliterally dependent on for your livelihood‚Äù not usually.
Do you have evidence that he isn‚Äôt? 
The evidence is in the title. OP says they've lived on their own for less than a week. That isn't enough time to get your shit together.
He just bought a house?
*One of us*
Because Reddit is great at forming hive-minds. Buried comments get sent to bottom where most can't see it unless they sort by controversial
>Why do people view a content aggregating website as a single one-minded entity?

The same reason you apparently think of all people as a single one minded entity
See if they have discounts for multiple days. The one I used to go to cost 15 bucks a day if you did at least 10 days a month. 
He looks like a berne to me, i don't know whats up with these other people.
He looks just like the rottie border collie my husband used to have. She would switch hard from acting like one breed to acting like the other it was pretty funny and she was awesome. It seems like you will know from how he acts in a little while. Congrats! 
Don't Bernese have white on the face, chest and paws?
Because if enough people abuse the system it may not last forever.  
Because, if people take advantage of a system that‚Äôs when people stigmatize it and eventually get rid of it, or fight to get rid of it, even though it helps people. Kind of like food stamps or other social programs. People who actually need a dog for *serious* emotional support (ie, veterans with PTSD) could be eventually denied because the social stigma is that people just label emotional support animals to get past the apartment complex‚Äôs rules.

A pet is emotional support after a hard days work, or a stressful day at school, but some people depend on them far more than just typical people problems. I‚Äôm not saying you specifically don‚Äôt have greater problems that you need a doggy for emotional support for, I‚Äôm just clarifying why people would think that may do harm to lie about it just to get past apartment complex rules. 
It is people like one of my co-workers who has absolutely no need for an emotional support animal who nonetheless pretends she does - people like her do hurt those who legitimately need them because they abuse the privileges, make everyone question the legitimacy of them, etc.  Heck I have a good friend whose cat is one - I totally support the legitimate use of pets for help, especially those who have been traumatized, suffering from PTSD, or medical issues where the animal helps.  I am glad your pet is able to help you in this way. 
Having people apply for emotional support licenses is not detrimental to anything. It‚Äôs not like food stamps they aren‚Äôt wasting other people‚Äôs money. It won‚Äôt affect people who legitimately need it so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs bad to take advantage of this system. 
I never said I did, common reddit user no wonder people make fun of this app
Quote it when he said it.
Looks a lot like a Gordon Setter, apart from the ears. A bit rarer in the U.S., though. 

Source: Sister owns a Gordon.
Yes, but being a mix you'll get different colors. Black & tan is a dominant color trait.
Yeah the color is not the same but the facial features look like a Berner. 
So then your point is null, dumbass. Burden of proof is on the person making the claim. 
Where‚Äôs your proof you brainlet? Don‚Äôt get your panties to tight up your mingey pussy.
