Spotted at my local cinema’s coffee shop:

*half the universe
Thanos is turkish confirmed.
Thanos skipped arm day
This is awesome, wish they did stuff like this in my town

Salt will only fall on half cooked steak.
How do you snap your fingers like that?
Pretty awesome!
Stone bae
Wait your cinema has a coffee shop?

That’s AWESOME!

Are you in the US or another country?
How is Thanos going to use his gauntlet if Vision has one of the infinity stones lodged in his forehead?

Does that mean it's just a given that Vision is going to die? 
He has other works also rather than gettin the infinity stones.

It's he going to stuff it with American cheese and uncooked asparagus? 
Goodness, that must have taken ages to draw!
The interesting part is your cinema has a coffee shoo
This is the best thing I've seen all day!
The Mad Titan has excellent beer pong form.
There’s for sure talent working at the cinema. Always seemed the aloof ones worked there
Bravo 
That meme feels like forever ago
ive never heard of a coffee shop in a move theater

Such a small price to pay for a cup of perfect Cortado.
Can someone Photoshop a fez and a mustache on him?

I would but I'm lazy.

In a universe where nearly illegible handwriting is acceptable next to a piece of art.
Welllllll.....
The exposed half will snap onto the gauntlet... so he’ll just have Vision stuck to his fist.
A perfectly balanced cup of cortado.
I expected Thanos to get a demi tasse
Sounds like every piece of art where the artist has to sign their name. You don’t know who signed it it could just be scribbles. 
Well, yeah? It does mean that Vision is going to die?

It seems like that's the secret that no one is telling me
Soooo are you gonna tell him or am I?
As all cups of cortado should be.
