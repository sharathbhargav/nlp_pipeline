Cate tries heckin hard to run with doggos

Gradient doggos
The dog to the left is staring into my soul
Huskies have a pretty intense stare.

Huskies about to race evolve to a maniacal vibe.
kat pupper doin a thousand yard stare. Now jus need to do a slack jaw and a tungflop.

I don't see no cate here. Are you talking about the doggo that looks like a cate
Omg I love Rosie as a kitty!
Cats are just tsundere doggos sometimes

There was an attempt
What cate? I don’t see a cate.
“What have i gotten myself into”

One of these is not like the other.

Downvoted for "Cate," "heckin hard" and "doggos." I don't care what sub this is, you're most likely a fully grown person but you write like an imbecile. 
Red huskies are my favorite kind of husky 
What is heckin hard?
Can someone please tell me if there is a way to block this stupid sub? I’m really sick of this cringey ~cute~ titles for stupid picures of turd-eating mutts
It's so cute,I have pet nail clippers here,if you need it,I can send you one,call me.
Doggos printer is low on ink.
Nice soul, fren!
*He knows.*

The dog to the left *"looks like the soul of a dead 19th century child"*

I'm on mobile and have no idea how to create a link within a sentence. Also I'm too lazy to find the name 
I feel like it has something to do with blue eyes. Every time i’ve met a dog with blue eyes they’ve had this crazy look to them while dogs with dark brown eyes don’t. Idk man i’m not a doctor 
I think he looks so ready! He’s got that subtle crazed look in his that cats do before they go zooming off and bat at something 
"Too close to the dogs! Need to go away!"
He looks like he just remembered he left the iron on.
They have a bunch of photos of three dogs and now there are only two in recent pictures.... What happened???
plot twist: the doggos are cates that look like doggos
Surprisingly similar eyes and mouth to Jeff the killer. Hmm
no swearsies the puppers dont like.

As opposed to?
You can always just ignore it. Otherwise, you should be able to filter /r/all to exclude it. After that, I don't know.
Please, I need this too
Also had an error printed a cat.

This made my morning...I made my dogs jealous 
I dunno. The third and fourth doggos look pretty cray cray too.
I feel the same way about people who have really clear blue eyes, especially when they have dark hair. 
Can testify that my blue eyed doggo stares into my soul at all times. It’s weirder because she hardly ever blinks. 
Yeah he looks more determined and *spunky*(?). He's runnin' with the big bois today and he's ready to rock.
I'm pretty sure this is him: https://www.instagram.com/huskymiko/

Might just be friends with Lilo's owners
I think that's their friend's dog Miko
Fren I do not understand. There is no cate.
Oh okay thanks auto mod. Sorry puppers, no more bad words

Omg. I'm not the only one? I'm the same way but especially with blonde hair. Its always put me off and I've felt so weird about it because I have blue eyes and brown hair. Every person I've ever been with has had brown hair and brown eyes.
