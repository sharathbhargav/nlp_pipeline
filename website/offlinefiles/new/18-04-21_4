Dad surprises his daughter.

Did you see the way she looks back at her friend? ' my DAD just turned up!! My DAD is here!!'  Then she just snuggles into his shoulder and she is home. Sniff. 
Man that is overwhelmingly beautiful !!
As a Daddy myself, this is a helpful reminder that each little hug I get builds security and hope into my little girl. Dads, don‚Äôt take these moments for granted!
I love how the daughter just abandons her bike on the track. So pure. 
When I see things like this, the meaning of life doesn't seem like such a mystery.
I thought the surface on the right was water, and that she was driving right into it.
Awful lot of cut up onions around these parts lately
What is this, the Royal Courtyard?
/r/aww
As the father of three boys, I just had a tiny existential crisis... and grew my very own ovary.
Is that a school? It's beautiful. 
I thought this was r/mademesmile, not r/mademereallytearup
Why is he in his dress whites?

Why are all of these people in uniform when seeing their family?!?

The first thing I did, once coming home from a deployment is get in some civvies and enjoy feeling normal.
She was looking back to make sure she was beating everyone at the race, and then she sees her father, and is like ‚Äúfuck this race‚Äù
Why do a lot of these people were their dress uniforms when they make these videos?
Original post from here I guess

I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying. 
I've always felt people who do this in public, show up wearing their fatiques or any other military outfit, and record it, are really attention whores more than anything else.


Get yo dirty ass boots off my dress whites!!!
That was a beautiful thing to see
r/noyourecrying
Homecoming videos with guys wearing their uniform really annoy me. It sort of cheapens a rather amazing moment.
Dad is u/KVsig07 if anyone wanted to know
So we all gonna just ignore how she left her tricycle in the middle of the lane? 
I thought the grey part was water and that she was driving into a pool.
Probably silly question, but why in all these videos, the father is always wearing their military uniform? 
Whelp, off to the next port. 
I love this. I come home from Iraq in a few months, I literally dream of having this same fleeting moment with my daughter after not being able to hold her for close to a year. 
God hes a part of the Vinson, quite an awful ship. Glad youre home bud.
Pure, sweet and innocent joy. Priceless.
Who‚Äôs cutting the damn onions
She looks back to make sure her friends can see because she's so proud of her dad üò©üò≠
WHY AM I TEARING UP THIS IS SO GOOD
My fucking heart is melting 
That little girl has some serious style. Nice boots. 
Also tears
My son does this literally everyday he gets picked up from daycare.
I‚Äôve never wanted kids. This makes me want 8
Where is this? That looks like a fancy ass playground
At first I thought the darker pavement was wet cement and the guy was trying to wave the girl to stop her from riding in it 
Why posting this on the internet? Family moments like this should be private not for sharing on social media...
USS Carl Vinson AKA USS Never See Your Family.

This is the good part of that, I suppose.

I wish I had a few on film.
It's so sweet!! One question though: who is filming the video and why didn't the daughter look at the camera direction even once? 
I clicked on this link without reading the title and that whole time I was thinking one of those kids was about to have a comical topple off their tricycle. I guess that's what the internet has me conditioned to expect, just videos of kids wiping out on bikes. 
This gif warms my heart in this land of bitter cold
I never get tired of seeing these sort of gifs. 
Thats a cool school
Its only navy. Nothing to see here.
That's a fancy ass daycare center damn
*r/mademecry
Wonder how many times Kubrick filmed this to get the final shot
Yvan eht nioj!
I thought that was a video game at first. And last
My father did the same thing for me for my high school graduation. He was out to sea in the Navy and was not supposed to make it. He had been gone for several months that when I saw him I didn't recognize him because he had lost so much weight. He gave me the letter of him requesting to fly home a few days early so he could make it to my graduation. It is signed by his superiors approving it. I still have the framed letter on my end table 17 years later.
He's never going to get those shoe marks out of the back of those whites. 
Sailor uniforms are so funny looking
Think about all the parents and kids who never got to see eachother again because of the line of work he chose to go into and therefore support. Glad the kid still has a father, but let's not pretend military intervention is utilitarian most the time.
Stupid vid. Cool I guess but couldn't he change or are we supped to care that he's in the military ?
I'm so sick of these god damn videos.
I swear man, these god damn onion cutting ninjas here...
Faaake.
As a vet who has come home from war l want to say fuck these homecoming videos. Its propaganda.  We knew we were signing up to abandon our families for a about a year at a time to go kill poor people. Stop glorifying this shit. Nothing honorable or heroic is happening here.  Should be titled "absentee father shows up to preschool dressed like a cunt."
Videos of parents coming home and surprising their family always make me want to cry. How cute.
No, I'm not crying...damn dandelion seeds floating into my eyes
Wheres his husband?
That plastic bag was like nope he‚Äôs mine!
I like how she pauses for a sec after stopping her bike
aww this is nice 
That little smile at the end was so so cute 
At first glance I thought she was about to bike right into a pool. 
u/KVsig07
Its posts like these that only furthur my want for a daughter to have moments like these.
I‚Äôm not crying 
Right in the feels
/r/MadeMeCryLikeALittleGirl
Daughter comes in last place...
Who else thought that the daughter was the girl sitting all the way at the end?
Ouch my feelers 
Im not crying, you're crying. 
My heart just melted 
I thought she is going to fall in the pool
These always make me cry. Every. Time. 
So many plastic bags :/
I love how she was slowing down and stopping thinking, no way and then that little wave from her father sent her running to him. Man allergies am I right.
alternate title: little girl smothered by seaman.
I don't think I would try to make a family knowing I'd be unable to see them for long period of times. Well, that's probably because I rarely got to see my father, and I wouldn't want that to happen to my children.
My daughter just kicked my ass in uno... she gave this hug after to comfort me. Watching this gave me tears and I went to hug her again for being a great sport... 

She laughed at me and told me to "get gud" 
Videos like this never affected me before my daughter was born, but now, I‚Äôm like emotional little girl haha. 
At what point does /r/mademesmile turn into /r/mademecry? Because I think this is it.
She was ruling the place on her Trike with her crew. 
So cute!
Alternate ending... He isn‚Äôt her dad... 


Who‚Äôs chopping onions in here?
The snug into the shoulder at the end
Wish I could‚Äôve attended that kindergarten... mine sucked 
I miss that time in my daughter's life. Don't get me wrong, things have always been fantastic with here, but there's something about that age. Great video.
Oh fuck, my darn hayfever again. 
oh my heart
allergy season is a bitch.
How comfortable are the dress whites? They don't look that comfy
That was beautiful.
Didn‚Äôt smile
more like /r/mademecry
Who's cutting onions in Florida mans office?!
so cute
u/God_is_Goood where did you come from? I've suddenly started seeing your name every time I'm on reddit ( ‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)
Makes me miss my dad üò≠
He was stationed on the U.S.S. Carl Weathers 
+1 for proper lifting technique.
My 4 yr old foster son does this every day I pick him up from daycare.  It never gets old.
In the first 2 seconds I thought the man was a Saudi. It's beautiful!! 
Do these videos make me more happy or more sad? The mysteries of life. 
The architecture of this place pleases me. 
Okay what day care center is this? 
Now we get to see this on facebook for the next three months. 
Hoorah CVN-70!!
All I can think of is ironing those damn wrinkles out haha.
How awesome is this. Kid didn‚Äôt even break stride
how rich are these fuckers?
Nice...but so much trash around?
My daughter is about that age, love when she gives me big running hugs and calls me ‚Äúda da‚Äù now and then.  I know it isnt going to last much longer which makes me incredibly sad.
Yo 400,000 karma in 31 days Jesus 
This man is cryptologist technician in Navy. What's that......?
Also, best recess ever. Those lil bikes are awesome. 
I usually don't get fazed too much by those "made to make you cry" kind of things but whenever I see stuff like this, with dads, I get emotional. Mainly because I didn't grow up with my dad and ever since I was a kid, I've always wanted a father & got jealous & bitter whenever I saw the other kids going out w/ their dads or stuff like that. I mean, I have a caring mom, but little me always wondered how it would have been like if I had both parents.
Was that the captain that killed some sailors?
This shit was fucking staged 
With due recognition of the Rifleman's Creed.  


This is my daddy.  
There are many like him, but this one is mine.  
My daddy is my best friend. He is my life.  
I will love him as I love my life.  

That suit seams ill-fitting 
What a beautiful video. And how adorable is she? That smile as she is hugs him... precious! 
I LOVE these videos but I always cry. It reminds me of my dads deployments and how good it felt to have him home after each one. 
Is there a sub dedicated to just military parents or family coming home?
My hero is here girls ...look aweww
[deleted]
/r/masterishome 
Awww man, that‚Äôs such a bliss to watch. My dad is a wee fanny and I have no contact with with my family whatsoever from past 5 years or so. 
I wish I have had an experience like this as a kid.
USS Carl Vinson. I served on her. Nice. 
That is the sweetest smile I‚Äôve ever seen. Goddamn.
Made me cry for 4 and a half hours
Can I just please tell you thank you so much for your service!  and by service I mean literally doing nothing in the Navy and sitting on your boat making tax free pay and getting paid + fed on tax payers dime! 

Thank you again!!! what a hero!
I would've dropped her disrespectful ass if she out her boots on my uniform like that 
Carl Vinson!, welcome home sailor üëç
Thank you for your service
She‚Äôs so beautiful 
Lol, I have a daughter about this same age and I assumed that the look back was her realizing the race was still going on without her and thinking about jumping back in it, but dad won out.
Thank you reddit for having a comment section that is both wholesome and funny and making me cry all the time. :-)
I‚Äôm not a little girl, but a 28-year old man, but snuggling into my dad‚Äôs shoulder and being home is all I really want one more time. He died six years ago today.
You know, I was holding my shit together pretty well until I read those last 4 words in your comment. Damn you.
I think she was looking back to see if she could still win the race she was in, then said screw it, daddy's home
Things like these make my day
It really is. Being a military brat to a man who was also in the Navy when I was that age this really starts boiling up some feels. I don't think I could ever replicate the happiness I got getting to see my father for the first time in over a year after being deployed. Except the only difference is we got to line up on a dock and wait for his ship to come into port. Really cool getting to watch it dock with all the sailors standing at attention. 
The best part of my day is picking up the kids from day care and getting a reaction like this 
The kid was so pure!
Right? I'm pretty sure my daycare didn't look like an Arabian palace of some sort.
Love this. This never gets old. Onion no jutsu forever. 
Just utterly heartwarming that she gets to see her dad after he's returned from overseas, helping the United States spread truth and freedom, by droning families and killing little kids.

EDIT: I live for these downvotes. Every time an ignorant American takes offense to one of my comments like this, I feel a sense of pride. I hope it hurts when you read it.
Wait till she becomes an adolescent, then she‚Äôll resent her dad for being gone all of the time
As an adult woman with a dad who was mostly absent, this is so beautiful and encouraging for me to see. You sound like the kind of dad we should all have, and I am SO happy for your little girl that she will know what this is like. Keep on giving her those hugs. 
enjoy it, mine are teenagers now, the hug amount had drastically been reduced,  I miss it. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEPvfZrXWPY
Just getting a pack of smokes
Yep. My daughter is almost 8 and still runs to me when I pick her up at school. It's the best.
I‚Äôm 25 and I still snuggle into my dad whenever I see him! I‚Äôm so lucky to have a dad that understand the importance of these moments and your daughter is so lucky to have you too!!! 
I don't mind staged things on Reddit because if they still look cool, funny, etc then I feel like that doesnt always change just becaude its staged. That said nice to see something natural like this.

Exactly...  thanks for putting my feelings into words....  spot on!!!
I feel the same way, I must join the Navy
I like that 
Ahhh I gotta message it up but it was 42 replies lol
Money and power
It's 42 btw
Came here to say this exactly
Yeah I was hoping to see a crossover to r/DadReflexes
It's ridiculous. All I want to do is browse reddit but somehow I keep ending up at /r/cuttingonionsnearby
It's these onion cutting ninjas, I tell you!
UAE expat compound with a school.
I was thinking the same thing, nicest playground I've ever seen 
He‚Äôs out of San Diego. Architecture around there is very Mediterranean and there‚Äôs a lot of private schools...this doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all.
Looks like a rich ass school in SoCal.
I haven't seen that much sunlight in months
I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw stained glass. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a Catholic school.
Just a really nice public school. I sleuthed out which one but I'm not telling the creepers on Reddit. Built several years ago for $30 million, pretty high enrollment capacity for an elementary.
Just the one?
/r/happycryingdads
Redditors are so cringy
I skipped smile and went straight to tears
You probably didn't get as many upvotes though
Most of these videos are often propoganda videos from a branch of the military. Not all though 
Get your fucking boots off my whites, do you know how long it took my to get my creases right!?!?
I was actually told to stay in uniform until I got to my home station. So if I had a family I guess I'd be seeing them in uniform too. 
For him it was because the ship he was on just pulled back in from deployment last week and if he wanted to get off the ship in the first few hours, he had to be in your whites.

Source: was also on that boat
You have to when you want to get off the ship when it pulls in. Luckily, I usually wasn't allowed off the ship until the next day so I didn't have to bother. 
Propaganda 
Honest answer...in general, it‚Äôs propoganda. Many of these videos are made by the military themselves as a way to promote the military. In 98% of these, they could have changed to regular clothes 
We‚Äôre all crying 
That, and sometimes the military sets it up (propaganda) . 
As a dad who used to wear those dress whites occasionally, man, they can be dry cleaned. He's not going back to work after this.

But to be honest, I would have gone home and changed before I surprised her for this very reason.
Yea, poor shirt.
[deleted]
He probably literally just got off a ship or military bus an hour before this moment. You expect him/soldiers to change their outfits first??
Military wear is ceremonial to a lot of soldiers and sailors. I promise you the uniform is the first thing that little girl looks for when she gets up on the morning. 
You have to wear them to get off the ship when it pulls in.
Because more often than not they either just got off the plane or their boat just pulled in from a deployment. 
Becsuse they are military advertisements not home videos 
I hope you two have the most wonderful reunion!
Good luck out there, man. Buddy of mine got out in February after two tours in the sand. Looking forward to seeing you home.
Thank you for your Sherpas!  

o7o7o7
I think she's looking back at her mom, and doesn't know the person who is filming to his right.     
You must be fun at parties.
DAE le cutting onions in this dusty room making manly tears amirite lmao??!
As a vet who has come home from war I think you should fuck off
I personally respect them. Not because of the wars our government sends us to, but because theyre away from their families in some shit hole, ready to give their lives and to defend us from any attack on our country or its allies. If we didnt have men and women signing up to join the military, our country would be unprotected and vulnerable. No I dont think theyre ‚Äúheroes‚Äù, but I do believe theyre willing to be one if need be.

Edited a few things
"As a vet"
Your opinion isn't right because you're a veteran. That's as pointless as saying "as a janitor"
You must be fun at parties
Thank you.

It‚Äôs a lil big, but so is your girlfriends snatch. 
Navy gonna give him up?
Someone's salty he got rejected by the navy
Im just here to say im not crying in anyway.
She has her priorities set.
I also have a daughter around this age. Nothing cheers me up more than those hugs from her that are so tight you can't breathe for a second. 
I'm a grown woman and my parents live five minutes away from me. I see them a few times a month on average. Your comment made me weep and think "I need to go hug my dad right now." 

I am so sorry for your loss. Sending you lots of love and comforting thoughts, internet stranger. 
üíö having a loving dad to snuggle, turns us all into little girls. A good dad is so special! Just think.... one day, it might be your turn to be 'home' to a little one, and  you can tell them all about the grandfather they didn't get to meet. Double sniff. 
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. What was he like? What‚Äôs a favorite story or memory you like to share?
But one day you get to be the dad.
Same here.
Truly r/MadeMeSmile worthy
You could even say it... made me smile. 
I had a similar experience as an army brat waiting for my dad to step off the plane after a year-long deployment, although I was a couple years older than the girl here. All the families got to wait beside the tarmac. It's a really nice memory.
For my husbands first deployment i got to see it pull in and was standing there with his brother, mom, and step dad and it was so much fun. It‚Äôs frantic trying to see your loved ones face when everyone sort of looks the same. The second deployment I got there slightly late but it was still exciting searching for him.
I really appreciate your comment. I can't begin to imagine what it would be like to have a father/mother away for a chunk of my life. My mom was stay at home and my dad was a pastor so he was always around. I always get teary when I see these videos/gifs of service parents surprising children/spouses, because it makes me so happy to see people seeing their family for the first time in a while. It really drives home how much of a bond family can have. Even if family is separated by states/countries/oceans they never lose the joy of seeing a loved one. Sorry just getting emotions out, gonna call my mom and tell her I love her. Have a wonderful day and I hope you still have a strong relationship with your family! üôÇ
Do some kids contain sedimentation?
Or she'll be proud of him and his sacrifices. I'm a military brat and I was/am proud of my both my parents and their service. 
Not really. I'm an army brat and I've never resented my dad for being away. I understood he had a job to do that required him to be away from home from time to time. Also, it's not like the service members don't have any contact with their family. We still got weekly phone calls from him while he was deployed, so he didn't feel all that "gone". 
Much edge
As a father of an amazing boy, I can not understand the absent father thing. What is it that these guys don't get? A hug from your kid is the most amazing thing in the world.
As an adult man with a father and mother that have always hugged us a lot no matter the age, I still hug my parents today everytime I see them and it means a lot to me. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing guys, you are amazing. 
Was that Lewis CK? 
This isn‚Äôt staged tho
And thanks for putting your feelings into comments... Spot on!!

I wanted that to be real so badly.
Makes for a sweeet Big Wheel track!
Where in the UAE would you find that backdrop?
Possibly San Diego.
It's a start.
They're called "Brovaries" 
I don't doubt it, but do you have a source?
The truth is hard for people to hear
Yep. Americans are really bad at recognising it because it's normal to them. You guys parade them around sports venues while applauding them, thank them in the street, make sappy Facebook posts, drive around with stupid bumper stickers, give them free meals and discounts, make movies about them, and just generally make people's life hell if they ever criticise the military.  

America has been taught to glorify them as if they're better than everyone else, and that's all because they want people to enlist and possibly throw their life away, while feeling like you're doing some amazingly selfless act.  

I love reading r/JustBootThings and seeing all the stupid Facebook posts about some kid who just joined basic and is sharing shit like "America, home of the free, because of the brave" like he's some badass hero.  

I absolutely love America and their people, but Jesus Christ, they really need to tone it down.
No u
If that‚Äôs the case, it is somewhat effective. I always think about joining the military when I see these, but then I realize it‚Äôs the only reason I want to do it and decide against it. 
Question: how comfortable are the dress whites? They look mad hot.
My husband has a tendency to just buy a new one if his gets dirty. 
No you both
It‚Äôs very well known that the military is heavily involved in many of these videos. It‚Äôs frequently advertisement/ propaganda for the military 
Yeah I also change whenever I get off a plane and head home
Thank you, definitely looking forward to it!
Thank you for your kind words, and thank your buddy for me too.
Most often not, because of my crippling social anxiety. I am quite funny when comfortable though, thanks for your consideration.
I respect your opinion. I know I'm being an asshole, but I'm not wrong.
Right, that's the sacrifice people refer to. I just think respecting them would mean ending war, not just going along with it. 
I'm just saying this based on my life experience with this specific topic. My opinion on how the military is glorified has nothing to do with my service other than the fact that I know what I'm shiting on inside and out.
You must be the guy who uses cliche comments that don't make sense. What else could he not be good at? Making cupcakes? What about dancing with the light off? Is he good at that?
AHAHHA rejected by the Navy. Is that even possible?
I'm not crying! YOU'RE CRYING!! üò≠
Yes, I think you do need to do that. :-) I did that way too little while I had the chance. And although the hole he left in my heart and life will never be filled, all the happy memories will also never fade.
I have a daughter about the same age, and I can tell you it's incredible life-changing and humbling experience to become the main feeling of 'home' and 'secure' to a little one.

It really resets any perspective I had about priorities and (non-kid-related) problems' criticalities. üòä

I get a hug like the one above every day (almost), and it melts my heart every time.
Here we go again. Endless sniff.
During his last months, while he was sick and mostly lying in bed, we listened to some Scottish folk song (by Loreena McKennitt) that he never heard before and we were both crying because we both felt so connected to it and at home (Scotland being our ancestors‚Äô homeland a couple of centuries ago). We understood each other very deeply without words really being necessary. I only learnt that during his last year.
#OH YEAH
Depends on how long you let them play outside. Eventually they'll eat SOME dirt.
Thank you for your service CommercialCommentary‚Äôs parents!
Really, I kind of think my Dad was an asshole for assisting America in using military force to push its agenda around the globe, but that's just me.
Fear, depression, negativity etc. not saying it‚Äôs an excuse, but it is the correct answer as to why this happens. 
Narcissism. Some people don't comprehend the world existing away from them and having a kid grow up and question them is too much for them to handle. I wish more parents thought about the adult they are raising.

Coming from a family of huggers, I've always loved the amount of care and love a hug can communicate :) hugs are the best things there is (unless you don't like physical contact ofc, always respect other people's boundaries :) ) 
Lol..re-read my WHOLE post.
Just because the most important things to me are not related to a basic biological function? 
Look out, we've got someone who thinks having children is something special
I see a lot of people bitch about having kids and no money...so

You‚Äôd be surprise how the military involved in various propaganda methods 
Nah, he's just a guy who probably didn't serve and hates these types of videos. Not that serving makes you a better man or woman, but some have chosen to hold their manhood cheap.
Okay.
No you both
You think about joining the military so you can abandon your family for months or years at a stretch and serve a corrupt government?  Glad you think twice about it!
They're actually kind of like wearing pajamas. Second most comfortable uniform after coveralls.

Yeah, they can be a little warm in the summer, but they're nothing compared to 100% wool dress blues.
K. 
But do you also film yourself?
Sure. 

Fatasses, criminal records, outright crazy, take your pick.

Good point, never thought of it like that 
Oof my bad I‚Äôm a little hungover 
Money is more important to you than respiration? Tough to spend all those fat stacks while you're asphyxiating bro. 
Yes... yes... remove yourself from the gene pool.
Help guys!! He‚Äôs just too edgy!
I have three kids and no money.  Why can‚Äôt I have no kids and three money????
So...what? People bitch about literally everything. Ever bitch about your parents? Does that mean you wish you didn‚Äôt have parents? 
How can i be 'more naked titties at the beach'? 
Which ovary produces the girl eggs? I'm hoping that's the one I got.
No et. al. 
*can he do that?*
Whats wrong with filming a special moment between a father and daughter? 

Stop being a bunch of annoying, cynical fuckwads. 
Ummm when I was in the Marines I saw ALL OF THOSE in the Navy.  The vast majority of the Navy is fat(or skinny and weak), I have heard about MULTIPLE criminal waivers offered to people.  

It's just a pathetic weak place to go for fat pathetic losers.  They go to the recruiting station and say "yea, I don't want to get into anything or do anything difficult or dangerous, so I will choose the Navy" have Z E R O respect for anyone in the Navy unless they fly planes or are seals or something(which is like .002%) 
Thank you, Alfred.

Fine by me. Live like idiocracy
Because I have a different outlook than you do?
Pretty much
I mean you are bitching about my opinion and obviously I've struck a nerve in this thread
Eat more twinkies, wear fewer shirts
All ovaries produce girl eggs, silly. It's the testicles that produce boy eggs.
The left one.
