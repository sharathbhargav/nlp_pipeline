My dad, sister, and mother on student residences at Karazin University, Kharkiv, USSR (1978)

How I would like to hear their story
Don’t panic but your dad may be Kendrick Lamar 
Now see, this is a legit OldSchoolCool post that probably has an interesting backstory behind it. I like how they're dressed
You should post this to /r/estoration. They could probably clean it up for you. Great photo, thanks for sharing!

What made your dad want to go to Karazin University with the steel curtain and such still around?
did your dad learn russian?
We need to bring the long skirt and top look back up again. 
they are so tall
Wow, mom was kinda hot.
Why did your dad go to Russia?
How many Black Russians are there? Just curious.
Now this is “The Americans” I would watch...
Your mom was gorgeous, OP. Like professional model level gorgeous. :)
What a cool story your family has!
Beautiful photo. Way ahead of its time. 
Your dad looks like detective Joe West in "The Flash", haha.
Super cool pic !
GREAT picture
Beautiful!! 
I'm guessing OP is the younger sibling?
Wow, awesome! I studied abroad at the university in 2013. Still a lot of international students coming to Kharkiv these days. Met a few from Africa.
Upboat becuz bassed black man xD xD
Username accurate 
Xorosho!  Where in Africa was your dad from?
This post was brought to you by All White Suits: 

Made specifically for distinguished black men and a few fancy lesbians
I don't think I've ever seen or heard of a black person marrying someone who was ukrainian, let alone russian. That's so cool!
I love that you used the Kharkiv spelling instead of Kharkov 
your dad is your sister and your mother? 
OP. I love this picture. Very cool!👏🏽

Just saw your post about your dad and Black Panther. Very touching. Sorry for your loss. 
Beautiful picture!
Such an interesting mix of cultures. 
Hey OP!
You got a beautiful family, man.
Gotta hug your parents for us, they probably been through a lot.

Anyone else panic for a second when this photo made it look like your screen was cracked?

Crack in the image makes it look like your mom is smoking. 
That's a cool ass looking dude 
Is that dark haired Ivanka at a USSR university?
Pinoneers! 
What a great pic! Would love to see what you and your sister look like. I bet you two are very good looking. 
I love this so much 
your mom looks like a model ...is that a lollipop in her mouth or a cigarette ? I think it looks like a lollipop 


#Thanks bot 
ITT: communist 
Dirty Commies
The Communist believed the ruskies utopia... It was pure BS.
Communist scum
My dad studied biochemistry at the university through a scholarship. He was from Freetown, Sierra Leone. After they got married and had a kid they both went back to Sierra Leone, knowing Ukraine wasn’t a place to raise a young mixed child. 

My dad had a few friends who did similar things. Some meeting Russian women as well. Some took them back to Sierra Leone. I know of one who stayed in Russia. 

Check out the documentary a Portrait in White and Black. Maybe it was a different time when my parents had my sister, but now it’s seems more are being left behind. 

Needless to say, the Russian side was very disapproving of this relationship and effectively disowned my mom. 

Edit: I’m having so much difficulty posting this on the Reddit app !

Edit x 2: It's because I had a link to the movie -_- ... or should I say documentary. It's actually a doc. Too early sorry!
My parents started to tell stories when I showed them this picture and title, enough interest I might post some of them..
If not for the year discrepancy ypur dad could be the blac dude in The Americans, that helps their russian cause of spying in the US, only that he choose to actually leave to russia

Edit: It's a show, The Americans. Amazon prime, about the cold war and how russians trained spies from young age and planted them in the states as american citizens, even had to have jobs and kids and then at night putting on disguises to go on missions. 

There's this black character, he helps them with their cause, even tho he was born there. He gets discovered because they think one of his gang, or him actually, killed an FBI agent so they hunted him down and Russia offered him home in Moscow but he decided to die guns blazing, get the feds off their backs.
Not gonna lie, I thought it was some old school Kendrick as well
Damn
I am panicking, Kendrick Lamar was part of the USSR 
I mean I see no resemblance to Kendrick at all
And I thought I was white. You really think that guy looks like Kendrick Lamar?
Yeah, just with a beard
And your Mom may be Svetlana
Shut up
Dont fucking panic?! I'd be loosing my shit he freaking the fuck out!
Did you really just say that he looks like Kendrick? I got a bone to pick...
If OP wants I could give it a try. The damage isn't too bad, it would be fairly easy!
Ha! 
Free education. They had and still are luring Africans through education. Not just in Ukraine/Russia but in China as well. I have a cousin who did this in China and like my dad said things were super difficult at the time for him (would have been the 90s). He’s still there though and very successful. Nothing is stronger than educated masses!
Lol "steel curtain"
Fluent. My moms English was pretty much non existent when they met. 
Long skirts had a moment a just a couple years ago.
Pentacostals still rock it
Kinda?
Mom was Ukrainian. Another country that has way more than its fair share of gorgeous women.
USSR or Ukraine, not Russia.
Kharkiv is in Ukraine
To create a cocktail drink
Russian women
Zambian here, tt's very common for Africans to go for Uni to Easter Europe. I've got five friends who I went to HS with whom are currently studying in Eastern Europe (3 Russia and 2 Ukraine) and two of them are currently dating women from there, apparently it's not so much of a big issue. Most students who go abroad from most African countries will either goto the UK, China or Eastern Europe. UK because Visas are easy for former colonies and you can live there for 6 months visa free. China and Eastern Europe because it's cheap and the countries are welcoming (Russia is not as racist as people portray it to like). Only the rich will go to the US for Uni as a single year's tuition is more than what you're going to pay for full 4 year degree program 
Depends on which bar you're going. 
Not that many now, but in Soviet times a lot of exchange students came to USSR from a ton of friendly countries. Some stayed.
Not enough
She's just looks like a typical Ukrainian. All of our women are hot.
I thought they were two different cities
Hey, major84, just a quick heads-up:  
**lollypop** is actually spelled **lollipop**. You can remember it by **i in the middle**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Nay, thee
Jerk
please leave
Oh no people are sharing oh god the horror 
Takes one to know one.
Well I don't see any capitalists giving away free education and healthcare to Africans. Hell, they can't even give it to their own people lmao.
I hope you find peace. When life is really fuckin’ heavy, hating others is a way to release some of the pressure, but it stirs something up inside of you, too. Drop the hate and you’ll have an easier time with your struggles. The conspiracy and Donald subreddits are toxic and if you ever want to recover and live a normal life, you’ll have to separate yourself from that world. You can still hold conservative values, but you don’t have to hate and mock — it only makes your conscience worse over time, almost unnoticeably, to the point where you realize it’s gone. Good luck on your journey.
I'd say its a fairly capitalist thing to do, leaving your homeland behind to pursue a way to improve your economic worth. The problem is that the capitalist countries couldn't beat USSR's price. Naturally, the invisible hand of capitalism pushed OP's dad to the USSR
Yeah Zimbabwe has quite a few engineers who were educated in the USSR/Russia in the 80s and 90s and who brought back Russian spouses  too. A lot of people still go to Russia and Ukraine today to get educated too, as well as South Africa and the UK
What a choice. Sierra Leone or Ukraine in the 80s. 
Where is your family now, OP? 
Did you grow up in Sierra Leone? Are your parents still there? Do you speak any Russian?
U stil dea Freetown? Ar sabi 1 or 2 blaqrushins...
No offense... but I still rather live in Ukraine than Sierra Leone if with the stigma.
What do u look like now? What languages do u speak?
That's so freaking cool. Do you speak Russian? 
My college friend has a similar story. His dad was from Ghana and went to med school in L’viv, and married a local woman. When he was born, the Russian midwife freaked out and screamed that he was a Чёрный дьявол (this was in the late 60s and I guess there weren’t that many African med students in western Ukraine at the time?). 

He moved to NYC with his mom when the MVD (under Gorbachev) finally let them leave. He said it was pretty weird growing up in their хрущёвка with no other black kids, but the Soviet education system was very fair.
Please do, would like to hear...
What are you smoking?
Edit: nvm now it makes a little more sense.
4/20 was yesterday.
Goddamn it. I should have screencapped the incoherent mess this was before he edited it.
Brah are you one of the Top Minds TM of Reddit?

Also I second the dude below, gimmie what you're smoking brah.
.
Love or lust
It rhymes so it must be true
Kendrick Lamarov
You act like life in the USSR was bad lol
I mean you can barely see his face from the beard/shadow, but yea from 3 blocks away, kinda looks like Kendrick tbh
And 2' taller.
Yes please!!
i want u to do it for OP
That’s right....Russian unis were top notch and they would recruit from different countries (early 90s). I almost went to Russia as well for undergrad...they told me that the first year was primarily for me to learn Russian and all the classes will be in Russian. 
I studied abroad in Beijing and the dorm was some Americans, but mostly Kazakhstanis and Africans. 
Luring? For what reason, may i ask?
i think the USSR at that time trying to having stronger influence on the world at that time, so they luring for students from almost all over the world (mainly third world nations) one of them is my country. i have a friend whom his grandpa's friend being sent by my country government
Come for the education, stay for the lovely Russian ladys... Or just Lady. 
When an iron curtain just isn't strong enough.
Recent pictures of them please. 
do you speak russian? i would love to hear your dad speak 
I told my friend to try it in the store the other day and she looked so damn beautiful in it but she didnt buy it. 
Nothing ever gets that hot in Ukraine... Except the Uranium rods. They melt down. 
give it time.
How do you know they were in ukraine?
idk if foreigners are able to use FAFSA, but most Americans don't pay cash for college, we just take out loans from the Government
I heard black Russians go well with Moscow mules.
I’m Ukrainian-American, so thanks LOL.
huh ...TIL
Fuck you, you’re probably a commie also
[removed]
Nobody shared anything under Communism. The bureaucrats and military stole everything from the people they claimed to represent, and sent them to prison camps if they complained about it.
Got em! Checkmate capitalists 😎
😢😢😢 your comment made me change my ways. I’m a changed man 😭😭😭
It seems every Uber driver in Cape Town was from Zimbabwe. The loveliest people I've ever met, sad that half of them had university degrees but had to work as Uber drivers. Really hoping that Zimbabwe has a good turn for once. 
Fam, are you Zimbabwean? Happy Independence. 
“Would you like to have your hands chopped off or would you prefer we just have you mysteriously disappear?”
Canada
No. My sister stayed in Sierra Leone until 10. My dad and mom were kind of all over the place trying to find a place to settle. My mom London... my Dad the US, mother was not approved for a visa though so they settled in Canada. I'm 14 years younger than my sister.

My mom never taught us Russian... She took her self out of the Russian community because of how they treated my sister and Dad. She said learning english was number one for her and wanted us to grow up being "Canadian".
He's referring to the series "The Americans", but I don't know wtf he's smoking while watching it. 
Also, English here, we count the dates the right way with day first and month in the middle
I’m from the ussr. It was not nearly as bad as some people here make it out to be but was still overall bad. More than anything, it was just a normal middle income country in many respects. Quality of life was mediocre, not horrific like India or Nigeria but not good like America or Germany either 

I will say that it got very bad around the 1989-1991 period though. That was when the bread lines really formed and resources dwindled 
Life was great if you were born into the right family. If not, enjoy your bread lines and unstocked grocery stores. Communism has ironically produced some of the greatest and most insurmountable inequality in history.
I was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine in 1980 - the same exact city where the pic was taken. We left when we were allowed in 1989 and came to the US as refugees. Life there was shitty enough to be let into the US as refugees. Think about that. 
Life if the USSR was bad
How about actually speaking to people who survived during the USSR. Life was not only bad, it was terrible. Very few had a decent lifestyle. Calorie intake is no indication of lifestyle, especially since the calories were probably bread based or something, not to mention the food wasn't grocery store bought, but grown by most people.
He was ours! 
On it! I'll comment when it's done (may take me a bit, haven't restored pics in a while :) )
Why did I not do this... Jesus.  That sounds awesome.
My friend’s dad did his electrical engineering from ussr.   
Came back to India with a lot of love for that country. 
The choice of that particular word makes offering free education sound so sinister.
Ya maybe not the right choice of words?
Hearts and minds...long con, diplomatic, soft propaganda....get the best and the brightest (possible future leaders) from the developing world to have a bit of affection for the Soviet system.

The Cold War was officially the USSR plus communist states against the USA plus allies but each side was trying to get allies and influence in the rest of the world.  A lot of shadow proxy war fighting going on in such countries sometimes spilling over into real wars (Vietnam, South America, Afghanistan, etc.)
"The Gulag Archipelago" was published in 1973 and did immense damage to the international reputation and standing of the USSR. So trying to turn around this PR nightmare was an uphill battle at that time. Of course, people from third world countries, particularly those aligned with the Soviet Bloc, would still come.  
I know you're hoping for some kind of Harlemesque 70s lingo sounding Russian but its not going to happen. Sorry bro.
Kharkiv is the second-largest city in Ukraine.
Because it says Kharkiv...
Do you know how to read? FFS
I believe FAFSA is only limited to US citizens. I know a couple of Universities in the USA that give scholarships, but you have to be exceptional. Moreover, you have to sit for SATs whilst Universities in Eastern Europe or China do not require that. In the UK, so many African high school examinations are considered IGSE/A-level equivalents
All us Americans  get is Orange Julius. 
Ok
Commie is not even an insult everywhere dumbass.
Piss off kkkapitalist swine
Never say that to anyone. Come on, you're better than that.
I’m honestly just trying to help. My little brother is around your age and he went through college with drinking problems, turned his political view far right, and fell into himself. He stopped visiting and started posting more shit to the Donald and became almost openly racist around our family. Now no one wants to be around him and, while it’s his own fault, I still miss him. When I see comments like yours I can’t help but be reminded so I’ll sometimes add a comment like that. I don’t mean to be condescending. If you ever need to talk, feel free to PM me.
Haha I was also in CT recently. Literally every petrol station attendant, waiter, cashier, etc was Zimbabwean. There’re no jobs in Zimbabwe so people have basically flooded South Africa, especially Johannesburg. We’re a very friendly and non confrontational bunch 
Omg that was 3 days ago wasn’t it? I knew it: I kept thinking April 18 is someone’s birthday or a holiday or something ha... our first independence day without Robert. Happy Independence!
chopped off and disappear, please and thank you 😊
What brought them over to Canada?
Yea boyyy...... east coast or west coast ?  

Toronto representing here. 
Amazing story! I also saw your post about going to Black Panther. Your dad sounds like he lived an amazing life.
My grandpa did the same thing when he came to the states from Sicily. He raised his kids “American” without teaching them sicilian. 
I'm sorry about the Russian community. I deal with the same thing (Russian mom, VERY Russian grandmother). I have grown up basically feeling 100% Russian even though I'm only 50%. My mom definitely has very progressive views, but my grandmother is stuck in the past. Just last week she said she didn't like my sister's Hispanic boyfriend because his parents might be "dark-skinned".

Your parents look and sound lovely!
It really wasn't. Western media wants to convince you it was, but in reality, the USSR was even better than American life at the time. A statistic that shows that is the fact that the average Soviet citizen had a higher average caloric intake than the average American. They ate more, along with many other things
I was born there too. It was mediocre quality of life, not like third world country bad but still much worse than America or Europe. Things took a big turn for the worst in the late 80s and early 90s and then it turned into a literal chaotic hellhole. 
Just keeping up to date on this
You said it, man.
Because early 90’s Russia was not a great place to live.
Lmao trust me, you would not want to go. Russia was the equivalent of modern day Venezuela during much of the 90s. 
Why would a dude from Sierra Leone sound harlemesque when speaking Russian you fucking idiot 
Ah, didn't know that 
You're not a pleasant person
Gay bars and library clubs don't count. 
Lol..this guy here actually is a commie bastard . (Fun fact: Marx was an A typical freeloading loser with no job. His dad was a wealthy factory owner. )
No I’m not
Good luck for trying but I doubt it's going to make difference with some people. And you are a good person.
Um isnt Zimbabwe the country that ran off all its white people and are now begging for them to come back?

Yea awesome place.
Mom wasn't approved for a visa in the states lollll
An airplane
Probably a plane, maybe a ship.
I dont have to believe Western media, I was born in USSR - life in Soviet Union sucked. The only period quality of life was somewhat comparable to West was during the 60s. After that both the variety and availabilty of goods started to drop slowly but surely. By the time 80s arrived vast lines for "deficit" goods was commonplace. My parents were in the waiting queue for car (we didnt have money for it anyway) and telephone (finally arrived in 1992) for years. I could go on and on. And thats only the material side of it, anyone capable of independent thought were quite aware that they were living in a cage.
What are you talking about, have you been there? I (still a teenager) had to stand in the queues in the 80s  to exchange coupons against butter, milk and sugar. And my parents wern't some hobos, but respected "middle class" people (an engineer and a nurse).
Americans have not suffered from famine of any kind since the Dust Bowl...
I don't think I've ever heard that, and even if it is actually true caloric intake isn't indicative of quality of life. 
Yeah, but that’s just because they doused everything in mayonnaise.  
Its possible but, do you have any sources.
You’re a pathetically ignorant buffoon dude...
good bot man
Good bot.
Good bot 
I can't imagine it's any better now.
Black people are all the same lolz. 
Literally just google 'Kharkiv' it takes 5 seconds
Didn't know gays were fond of communists. Who knew? Why don't you go out of your home and see the world ? Might learn a thing or two.
> Marx was an A typical freeloading loser with no job.

lol no, he was a journalist and made a fair amount of money through his writings. But k whatever, nice ad hominem attacks on the most influential philosopher and economist in the last 2 centuries.

Yet, you deleted your comment. Hope the military sorts out your issues.
Really?! Well I'm glad that my nation gained a great family as a result of the US :D 
My family ended up in Canada as well because US was taking too long with documents. Better choice by a fucking mile, in retrospect.
That’s crazy. Oh well as an American id rather be Canadian. 
I would hope an airplane. But maybe a submarine? 
Two airplanes 
Definitely as Soviet battleship!
I will attest to that. My mom (born in 58) said life as young girl in her village was really good. Her family wasn’t poor and had a lot of food (from their farm). She wasn’t there when things got really bad. 
Notice how he shits up when confronted with reality?
The last famine in the USSR was 1947, so really not that much later

Yeah poor Americans eat more calories on average than rich Americans...
My grandma tells me all the time that life was more enjoyable and better back then. This is coming from a person who hates socialism too 

Edit: lmfao at people down-voting what my grandma told me about her past life in the USSR 
Oh, it's a lot, lot better now...which should tell you a lot of how bad it was during the 90s.
That's because you're ignorant 
I assumed USSR=Russia. You're still not a pleasant person
I googled 'atwood43'. It returned a stained wooden dining set. 4 seconds. 
>  From far and wide,

>  O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

Well done neighbors.  Our loss, your gain.
How do you know? 
So edgy brahhh
Grandma lol. 
I'm yet to meet a single grandparent of any background who doesn't have a nostalgia-boner.
That is quite common. Lots of people who only knew life under planned economy were completely unprepared for capitalism. Especially for the robber baron capitalism of the 90s. Those experiences left them scarred and they started to view their youth in Soviet Union through rose tinted glasses. Especially now that they are old and have larger medical expenses. 
Sorry man, the other guy was not pleasant but still the city name was literally in the title not even in some OP's comment.
haHAA ur so funny dude ;) 
i'm always so proud to raise that maple leaf flag anytime anywhere anyhow! 🇨🇦
Ever heard of healthcare and social safety net? Probably not if you're in US.
Well who the hell do you want me to get an opinion from that lived during the USSR era? The only ones old enough and live through it are grandparents now....
But I didn't know that kharkiv is in Ukraine. I thought Ukraine and the USSR were separate countries
As a Canadian - zing!
My healthcare is fucking fantastic and I make 14 dollars an hour.

Dont believe the bullshit that healthcare is so unobtainable here...honestly its not too hard.
Ever heard of freedom?
[deleted]
Ok, fair enough. I assumed you would knew as it is a fairly well known city. Cheers.
You're right Canada is a police state with a war on drug...oh wait nope that's the US.
Hahaha
Gotta go back in time and tell my parents to get a PhDs from an institution recognized in US. I'm sure that's possible in Ukrainian SSR. Thanks for the tip.
It really is worse than they can imagine. Even with employer provided insurance, it can be extremely expensive to be sick. Education is great but if you're an entrepreneur you're not going to be able to afford to insure yourself until you're successful. The American private health care model is an international embarrassment.
No country is solely made up of 'educated' people. The fact that you think that mitigates the issue in any way is absolutely disgusting.
My cousin is graduating with his PhD from Yale next month.  He loses his school-provided health insurance as a graduation present.  And he has a job lined up, but nowhere hires until September the way the school year works.

Yeah...so, education really helps...
What country are you from? I don't think many Americans would have heard of Kharkiv
