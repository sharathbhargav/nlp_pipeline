Had to pause my bike ride on the way out of Santiago to capture this gem.

I don't even get it. Must be getting old.
What has it got to do with McDonalds explain captain
# **FUCK NO**

AT MY COLLEGE THERE ARE PUBLIC PIANOS

AND ONE OF THEM IS RIGHT OUTSIDE THE QUIET STUDY ROOM WHERE I LIKE TO WORK

AND YESTERDAY *SOMEONE WAS PLAYING DESPACITO FOR FUCKING HALF AN HOUR*

I had finally gotten it out of my head

***tHEN YOU DID THIS***
Next Pass-ito,

Just 400 metres and then you will meet-o,

Our restaurant in which we shall greet-o,

You and then you can grab a seat-o,

So then you. Can. Eat-o.

r/despacito
awante la ruta 68

o la 5, ya ni me acuerdo donde la ví, pero si he visto ese letrero
despacito 
Qué salida de Santiago es? No es que quiera quemarlo o algo así.. 
Despacito also means slowly in Spanish so there might be another meaning hear.
MTS, M-T-S, I mean......
Yet another reason to avoid McDonald's like the plague. 
Epic.
i like that version of the logo though. nostalgia.
r/pyrocynical
Time to visit McDonald's
Buen Camino!
I think that sign would say "a 400 BellMTS" now. 
Gem you say?
I don’t know the words so I say pacito
I don’t know the words so I say dorito 
I don’t know the words so I say mosquito 
r/okbuddyretard
Someone deep fry this
But why's McDonald's background blue?
Despacito and Santiago in one post? Double meme
That song is dirty as shit. Why would a family restaurant use it for advertising? Lmao 
Despacito is EPIC
This is pretty tame compared to the time [they paid justin timberlake to sing their jingle](https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1227-the-contentious-tale-of-the-mcdonalds-im-lovin-it-jingle/)

But... Despacito is epic!!!
Santiago, the capital of Chile, a predominantly Spanish country. I assume that says “slow, McDonald’s 400 meters” or some bull like that
Como orgulloso Puertorriqueño que soy, quemenlo !
Se iran a dar cuenta que esto no atrae mas personas?
I still don't get it, go slowly to McDonald's? 
It's a play on that stupid fucking song that beat out Gagnam Style on YouTube for the most views, Despacito. Don't google it; you won't like it. 
I don’t get it either. they must be marketing to a really specific demographic 
Its a song that became super popular in summer.
Despacito can be translated as "Slow down".

The message bellow says that a McDonalds is near (400 m)
What kind of dickhead puts a piano next to a study room??

Lol do we go to the same college? My uni has playable pianos all around campus outside right now 
I love covers of songs in unusual styles, I'd actually like to hear that. Maybe not for half an hour, but would definitely like it. 
That cRESCENDO you did at the end is a tumblr thing and after seeing it so much on r/thathappened it’s starting to really piss me off.
Dude I wish my school had public pianos 
Heh, here in UK I have to listen to that crap about 2 times a day because of my s#itty workplace that blasts like 25 songs on repeat or something and that's just... I don't like it basically
oh ok
why aren't you camping
Si en Ruta 68 estaba!
deespasee2
I don't hear anything...
Yes.
That's the part I get, what's with the "dees" part?
Sooooooo, I'm a hard Rock and classic rock guy to the core. 

But I just heard the Spanish version or whatever of despacito, the one without Bieber, and I absolutely love it
It's a good song. Popular to the point of annoyance, yes, but at its heart it's harmless.
You're not my supervisor!
How can you not like Despacito? Do you just not like music?
The rubber chicken version is good tho
Is it in to hate Bieber again? 
Why did that beat gangnam style? I mean, it's a decent song but still... Not saying I'm a huge fan on gangnam style but it at least had a fun and easy dance. 
Ohhh ok thank you
The same kind of dickhead that'll play despacito on it for an hour

Wut
***FUCKING LOBSTER***
https://youtu.be/GmtTDvNcXcU this is a good one I found
This is the worst part: he wasn't even playing an arrangement. *It was just the melody*. It was all stunted too, like he was still learning
deeznuts
Despacito means "slow down".

They are just playing out the song for you to slow down since there is a Mc 400m away.
I think it's slang for McDonald's. Like how some ppl call it MickeyD's.....
It's just lengthening the sound of the first syllable.

Yeah it's great minus the Biebs
OP: Am I out of touch?

Also OP: No, it's the people who gave the song 5 Billion views who are wrong.

It's in Chile so it's in Spanish. It's just playing out the song
hating the biebs is so 2012
I've never even heard the Bieber version. The normal one is always on the radio though, and I love it!
Bieber had a great remix 
I don't hate the guy; I just hate his version of Despacito 
I just listened to his hits. Can't understand what people's problem was. It's top notch catchy shit, sounding like he's giving people what they demand in pop.
2005-2016
The music isn't the problem. The person is. He's a shitty person, but I also don't know what anyone expected when he became a multi millionaire at like 15 years old
He’s actually like... really good.
I don’t even think it’s the money, I think it’s the fact he can’t do anything like a regular person. He was a millionaire for a few years and was still a nice dude but after a bit he became sour, but I really don’t blame him.

[Check out videos of the paps with him.] (https://youtu.be/BKeqlVofX9k) Imagine being followed literally everywhere and as soon as you’re in fresh air you’ve got cameras in your face and people asking you dumbass, pointless questions. I saw one where he was coming out of the gym and the pap lady was like “God bless you for working out Justin”. Paps are literally ridiculous people, absolute scum of the earth job in my opinion. I know why they do it, but regardless, you have to be a special sort of weirdo to do that job.
