I'm so excited to go to the bathroom with you

Trying so hard to contain the excitement but still gonna dog out.

I love it when my puppy does this. Kills me every time.
These are some of the best and most vigorous taps I've ever seen. Well done, little floof.
So much love radiating from all that fluff! 
What a squish! 
Dat vigourous tail swishing though
Doin the pee pee dance for you.
What a cutie pie!! Needs a face trim real bad! Lol
This is truly the essence of this subreddit. Grade A tippytaps. Thanks for sharing!
Anyone know what kind of dog this is? Our rescue was a mutt and looks just like this one! Always have been curious
I want to just scoop him/her up and give em a big hug
It's like a hot rod dog, the back legs are bigger than the front. 
happy cake day （ ＾ν＾）
Get this dog some tapping shoes, and a top hat pronto 
Happy cake day!
Happy cake day 
Happy cake day OP!
Is this video sped up?
A dog needs a pat.
i can hear the tiny “boofs”! 
I do Sheetrock repair and paint.
Can we get a video with sound?
Looks like my star that passed a while ago. Im happy but sad.
Can I hang out with your pup? 
I just want to be buds with him/her
im sorry to hear that
Its OP's cake day.
Absolutely! 
She's a toy poodle and shihtzu mix!
Yes she is a toy poodle/shih tzu mix 
I have a purebred Havanese that looks close to this. Really depends on the grooming though. 
She is such a cuddler
Nope
I’m wondering how he respawns 
Thank you!! That confirms our suspicions somewhat. We knew no doubt our dog had some poodle in her, but not shihtzu!
Made me tear up a bit we lost our toy poodle shih tzu mix a couple years ago and he had one helluva personality :’)
he respawns right in front of the dog, such tragedy
My dog looks very similar to this. Maltese/poodle mix
Like a cute Sisyphus
