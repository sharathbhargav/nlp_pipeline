I heard the sound of a chair scraping across cement so I went outside to investigate. This is what I found......

“Oh, you’re going to take a picture before you help me? That’s cool.”
I’m not stuck you’re stuck
Not a bit of panic in his face. He knows you got this. 
Do you have any food
He’s like, I don’t know how it happened, stop with the pics and help me!

I really wish I hadn't lost the picture but one morning I hear all kinds of noise downstairs so I go down to investigate only to find my lab with a hamster ball stuck on her head.
Was camping on the lake in the summer. Nice breeze, a little fire going, just a tad bit after dusk. Suddenly a very loud noise came to my attention, glancing in the direction of this loud and very fast moving noise I see a ghost chair rapidly moving thru the wooded path. Was a sight behold, my brain trying to process how is this chair moving so fast and quite erratically. Bounce up and down side to side upright, ghost chair I believe describes it quite nicely. Before I really had a chance for my brain to react to this particular situation, the ghost chair decided on its own to change course and involve me in its magic. To my surprise it was a medium size black dog with it’s leash caught on a camping chair. Scared out of its mind with a mean old chair chasing it. I freed the little girl and did my best to calm her down before we started wandering to find its owner. 
  I hope I never forget this memory though it was scary for the dog,it’s vivid weirdness was a sight to see. 
Mistakes were made.  Still a good doggo. 
That face screams " so, are you taken with what I have accomplished"

Made me remember my old cocker spaniel. Once there was a plastic bucket on our concrete patio. He pushed it with his nose, which made the bucket make a low scraping sound a lot like a growl. It escalated quickly into him aggressively snarling and pushing this bucket that just won't stop "growling" back. 
Do you know what breed he is? I adopted my girl from the shelter and they told me she was some breed that doesn’t exist- our doggos look exactly the same! 
Edit: [dog tax ](https://imgur.com/gallery/XUiV8vT) -her name is Penny, she’s really fluffy, and 45lbs of solid love! 
"Yeah yeah, alright, that's funny ha-ha. Sure go ahead and take a picture instead of helping me."
"This isn't funny, Karen. Put down the phone and help me..."
oh gosh. he looks just like my old girl, same spotted paws and his lil face looks so much like hers! same disposition to get stuck. she passed 6 years ago and the reminder of her fills me up with love 
"I know what this looks like, but I actually have everything under control."

Cement is a powder. You heard the chair scrape against concrete. Cement I'd to concrete what flour is to cake 
fun was had. mistakes were made.

A couple years ago me and my gf were in the living room of our old apartment and heard this loud sound of destruction. Ran to the window to investigate. Sure enough, a woman tied her dog to a metal chair while she went into a market across the street. Dog proceeded to run about a block and a half with the chair in tow. The owner ran after the dog and then had to bring both dog and chair back to the market. She was not happy. Watching the dog and chair disappear as the dog ran for freedom was one of my favorite things. I have pictures of the lady bringing the chair back, alongside her dog.
OP I bet you put that dog in there like that. 
Wow that is a massive spider
Tough Doggo: whatcya starin at punk? 
A kitten of mine did something similar. She decided to jump through a space in the wood on the back of a chair. She got stuck and we heard screaming meows and went to check on her. Her two siblings looked like they were trying to help her and she was stuck halfway and hanging there lol. 
Lol, the look on his face: "Don't judge me."

Hi! Do you have a second to talk about our lord savior?  
My dog tried to jump over a low metal fence yesterday, but there was a tree about a foot away on the opposite side blocking his way, so he landed with one of the fence posts right up his butt.  I was so relieved he didn't need to go to the vet, because there would definitely be some questions.  Dogs are amazing idiots.  Like, impressive idiots.

i used to work at a Field Maze and glorified petting zoo in Massachusetts. One day I am sitting in the front office going over the day's work when a call comes on the radio, "Anyone been out to the Second Pasture and seen Brook?" This was our mascot cow, a ginger Scottish Highland. 

Myself and a couple other hands go out, Brook has managed to wedge her horns through the gap in a 8' bale cage and couldn't get out. Wasn't a matter of just not twisting her head right, she was actually trapped, the gap was too small, we had to warp her horns out of shape to get them to pass back through.

You have very good hearing to know the sound of a chair scraping. I would’ve assumed a table or a bench. 
This is one of the reasons that dogs are cooler than cats.  Had that been a cat, its spastic attempts to free itself would have destroyed much of your backyard, if not your entire house! =D
Dumb for a Border Collie lol 
Dog gets stuck and the first thing people do is take a picture. We are living in the age where people just constantly so that and it incredibly disturbing. If i am stuck in some quick sand or a mud pit people will be so busy taking snaps and posting it to instagram forget even getting help. Smh
I have worked in animal hospitals and at animal control. I have killed quite a few. For every one I’ve killed because it was hostile I have seen another that given a loving home and proper training wouldn’t hurt a fly. 

I also have a huge scar on my face from a black lab that snapped and bit me for no reason whatsoever. 

All dogs have the ability to snap. All dogs have the ability to be good. All dogs have the potential to be the opposite of what their breed is characterized as. 
And I go from a story of a loyal old dog hero staying with a 3 year old overnight in the bush:

Looks exactly like my border collie!
We got a puppy from the shelter and they told my husband she was a chow chow. She’s not even close to a chow chow. Doesn’t have straight back legs, is completely black, has a few spots on her tongue and that’s it. Met a guy at Petsmart who said she looked exactly like his border collie. We think she’s border collie/lab mix. 
Looks like blue heeler border collie cross, an ex used to have the same

Down to the slightly spotted feet and the face and everything, almost identical. The exs pup had a bit of spotted white on her chest too but otherwise 
Another chiming in to say border collie/lab mix. Looks exactly like my family's last dog. So so smart but she also did goofy shit like this 
I had a border collie black lab mix, looked like a spitting image of this guy.
I have a dog that looks the exact same but 12 lbs. When I google Schipperke and Border Collie mix, I find the exact look.  
It's a King Charles Eames Spaniel
This really spoke to me, thank you for this. Dude. I can't believe I never knew that. Then again, I've never had to do any work with cement or laying concrete. But I *do* like - & bake - cake ;)
I assume it's a Border Collie, or at least a something else crossed with one.

Looks quite a bit like my Border Collie/Golden Retriever cross.

Is the dog in a dangerous situation? Is it about to die? NO . If this is the scenario a quick photo is not hurting anyone. If someone is dying and there is a nobody helping, no one is going to be filming unless there is already help.

You sound like a arrogant 70 year old.
Huh, same as people. Also if that dog bit you at your workplace, he might have had a reason.
The people downvoting apparently are experts with animals and who have seen many more animals.  Or they probably just have less than 3 and believe they are wiser...  Lol...

I guess I should have mentioned the hamster wasn't in it at the time.  Someone just forgot to put the "door" back on it.
That’s what we think she is! She makes for a crazy first dog, but we love her. She was surrendered by her old owners for being “too active” cue *eye roll* She’s chill as can be in the house but once we get outside it’s game on, she gets the immediate zoomies. Give your dog all the boops for me!
I have a border collie lab mix! Looks very similar to this pupper

Ok, we need a pic of the pupper sleeping on this chair!

Is he your pup?
Yep, my dog poked his butt on a fence post yesterday.  He's surprisingly fine, but it was pretty horrifying at the time.  He's too heavy for me to lift, so I'm glad he was able to free himself.
Yeah I assume he was scared, but it was literally out of nowhere. Downvote me all you want. I don’t need imaginary internet points that have no real world use. 
Shit bulls have hurt me. 

Well not me per se but two shit bulls broke out of their yard, scaled our 7 foot fence like it was a step and maul my family's chocolate lab in front of me and my brother.

And their owner was a very nice man. Exercised them regularly, was kind to them, an ideal dog owner. 

They just cant help themselves, they're not suitable animals to live around other pets and or peoples kids.

>they have a bad rep

Yeah... no shit. They've earned it.
No. Shitbulls are awful.
You can really tell a persons age by whether they use Facebook frequently or not 

If so, they’re usually 25+ in my experience
Dogs use buttbook instead of facebook.

In dog years she’s 28.

Edit: gender clarification.
26 year old here, I used to use Facebook pretty frequently up to this year. It's completely different than it used to be, it used to be all statuses from my friends and everyone would comment and have a good laugh. Now it's all political bs and fake info "memes" . 10% of what's posted by my friends was actually their OC. 

I realized that when I was scrolling through the feed I was getting more pissed off about what was shared than I was getting enjoyment out of it. I still have a Facebook account in case I need to get into contact with anybody, but I deleted the app off my phone so I never get on or post anymore. My battery life has never been better.
is the younger realm all instagram and snapchat? 
You don’t even know the struggle. 

Friendster=>MySpace=>FB =>IG =>Reddit

There used to be a time where you could post anything and everything. Mainly bc most prevailing powers at the time didn’t understand and didn’t look into the “internet”.  

It was the Wild Wild West. We were all cowboys/girls. And like the WWW, that www. was a brief flash of freedom that is now gone.

Honest question here, why is it just pit bulls that have a bad rap? I mean if it was about the owner wouldn't it be all kinds of dogs especially bigger ones doing stuff like this? Why is it mostly pit bulls? Or does the media make it seem like mostly pit bulls? Or do pit bulls really have a higher tendency to do stuff like this? 
You see the white on the muzzle? I'm guessing at least 56. And I'm guessing it's a she.

Deactivating my Facebook drastically improved my life. I was spending so much time just mindlessly scrolling through it and occasionally seeing a post from someone I haven't talked to in years that I didn't care about. If you deactivate it, you can still use messenger. 
36 here - otherwise 100% same here. 
I’m 30. I still scroll through Facebook once or twice a week to see what family’s up to, but rarely post. There’s a few holdouts of single, childless friends my age who post regularly, but at this point, it seems that the people still using Facebook frequently are my parents’ generation and the people with kids. 
Yeah that's why I switched to Instagram. Just pictures. 

Also I follow a lot of hot girls and dog accounts so any time I'm down I just open it to cheer myself up. 
I slowed way down on my usage these last couple years. It's such a shit site.

But i still use IG so whatever
Pretty much, Twitter is also pretty popular 
It’s okay! Nothing wrong with that, I’ve heard they have some decent videos on that side of the web
How many political posts do you make a day? 
What about in dog years?
Might be their demo, but I know very few people who use Facebook under the age of 21.

It's not censored this time?
Username.... Checks out? I think maybe we should have dinner first though.
its the right amount of letters, this has to be it.
I have no idea what the statistics are but I’ve heard some breeds are associated with certain traits. While pit bulls are considered aggressive I’ve been told labs are really smart. My chocolate lab is and was a pretty fast learner (well, for potty training) but my yellow lab is a fucking nutcase who did learn potty training with minimal troubles but likes to jump on people. This is probably because the chocolate lab is English I believe and the yellow is American. Or I may have them reversed
It has a lot to do with pit bulls being used for dog fighting and they're strong. As to the dog fighting, yeah if you have a pit bull used in dog fighting now at a shelter, it might be prone to acting up. Doesn't mean all pit bulls were used in dog fighting. 

Second, they're strong. I can't look up the source on mobile but smaller dogs like chihuahuas have been documented as more violent than pit bulls, it's just that when they bite, it doesn't really hurt as much. 
yep, can confirm. I'm 28, and a 23yo once told me, without intent, that she doesn't really use her FB because it's for "older" people. I didn't touch Facebook for a ~~month~~ day
Never was a twitter fan. But i use snapchat a fucking lot
Because I manualy typed it out.  When I use the handsfree typing it types it up censored. I've scrolled through settings and can't find where to disable that. 
Hilarious.
I see but I'm assuming most of the dogs involved in stuff like this haven't been involved in dog fighting? So basically the chances of having a pitbull do something violent are higher especially because they're stronger? Does this mean that even if not all of them do stuff like this the breed is kind of unpredictable? Or are all the violent incidents due to animal abuse?
Cocker Spaniel okay it picked that up.    c********* nope. Hahahaha
I might have been unclear. Assume it this way. All cars are just as likely to be involved in a car crash. But would you rather be hit by a Corola or an F150? It doesn't mean one car is more likely to be in a car crash, just that the bigger car will get more damage. It's the same way with dogs. You're not likely to report the chihuahua for biting you as you are the pit.
