What's the purpose of the two different style of claws? Do they use them for different tasks? 
Ded-a-chek?
I remember when you could catch boys off the Jersey coast all the time. The place was lousy with clergy.
My father grew up in Newfoundland during the Great Depression and tells me that lobsters were something that poor people ate. Back then you wouldn't touch them unless you had to. It is only in "recent" decades it has become a delicacy. 
Edit: his family were not rich; they ate lobster. 
Those lobsters are swole. They look like they know Spongebob.
Damn if we didn’t suck there could be lots of old ass lobsters walking around this size 
They've got him in a classic pincer manoeuvre
Lobsters really are sea cockroaches. Look at the one one the right, even the head looks like a damn roach.
Do lobsters always have one beefier claw and one slimmer one? I’ve never noticed before
I get it how as a fisherman finding those lobsters would be really cool, but, those must have been some really old lobsters, and it's actually a real shame they were trapped and killed by people.
Little did you know but that boy grew up to be Jordan B Peterson. 
Are you saying New Jersey is Skyrim?
They don’t appear to have been eaten. Or were they emptied of meat and eaten?
Is that an old school Boy Scout uniform?
Did anyone else misread the title as saying "A boy mounted between two lobsters"?
Can anyone tell me why the two claws are different shapes? What purpose does each claw have?
I am almost positive these are two bad-add lobsters posing with a mounted boy they caught of the New Jersey coast ~1916.
TIL lobsters can be right or left handed. Mildly interesting...
**Fun fact**:  In the early 1900s, due to the expense of transporting fragile bananas great distances and still remain fresh at their destination, children were actually cheaper than bananas, and thus more commonly used for scale.  
It's like the Arthuc C. Clarke book *Songs Of Distant Earth* [Hover for spoilers.](/s "With those huge sentient lobsters who cut nets, trashed equipment, and collected metal for ornamentation. Anyone remember if they cut undersea cables with their claws at some point? Man I should reread that book.")

Those things were probably so old.  Humans just gotta kill everything old and huge when they find it, like those massive redwoods with moustache dudes standing next to them with two man saws.
Didn't know Jordan Peterson was that old.
Lobsters have a crushing claw and a shredding claw. Orientation (right vs left) of the claws ~~indicates~~ is not related to gender. One of these is male and the other female, but I don’t know which.

Edit: fixed it
Wow Jordan Peterson looked much better when he was younger
But where did they catch the lobsters?
Let's all just remember that lobsters piss out of their faces... That would be a large piss.
Rock lobster?
Is the boy mounted too?
Why are lobsters not that big anymore? Did we eat all the large ones?
That's some HR Giger stuff right there. Arthropods are inherently creepy, even if they *are* tasty.
They caught a little boy off the Jersey coast? They probably should have thrown him back so that he can grow to maturity. 
Those lobsters being there are why the Jersey Shore shark attacks happened in 1916. They were Keeping people safe.
Dont lobsters live forever if they are left to their own devices?
Craaab people.. craaab people.. taste like crab, talk like people!
Larry...is that you!?
Alittle butter ..meal for a king... Add the kid and a meal for king of pop
I sifted through the comments some but couldn’t find an answer to what’s up with that kid’s outfit?

Also, he’s been dead for some time. I wonder what kind of a life he had?
Damn! Imagine the size once GE starting dumping PCBs into the waters!
Jordan Peterson lobster army kidnap and hold child for ransom. 2020
South Park had it all wrong....It’s the Lobster People who are trying to turn us all into metrosexuals
I want to know what the three of them were doing off the New Jersey Coast.
I saw a mud crab the other day.  Horrible creatures.
When I first saw this scrolling past I thought the kid was being inducted into some Cthulu sea cult.  Glad it's just a harmless photo lol. 😄
Who am I? 
And why am I condemned to be 
Boiled alive? 
When all that I have done
Is live my life. 
I wonder what photos like this they'll have of us (2018) in 2118.
I have one this size also “framed”. Caught off the coast of Rhode Island. The beast was at least 30-35lbs. I think the largest is around 50lbs 
Now you know why the Mob loves the Jersey shore
“These big meaty claws ain’t just for attracting mates!”- Mr. Krabs
Holy Moly! They don't make them like they used to! 
I always find it weird when food snobs won't eat something because that's 'poor people's' food, if something tastes nice, eat it.

You're the one's missing out otherwise.
I am sure that poor kid had nightmares for years afterwards.   Probably didn’t  like seafood either. 
My uncle always made me pose with his freshly gutted deer.
the one on the right looks like a fucking cockroach
DAE think this looks like an aerial view of the subjects laying on the sand?
How do you mount a lobster?
That is the face I would expect of a boy posing for a photo, between two large lobsters.
/r/jalenandjacoby is the sub for all lobster fanfare
This looks like something from The Fallout 4 DLC
That’s a cod’s trophy wall with the kid he accidentally caught once
Damn I wanna eat the shit out of those tails 
Must have taken them hours to reel him in. 
They used to catch boys off the NJ coast?
This looks like a shot out of a Wes Anderson film
nobody is asking in th etop comments but WHY ARE THEY SO BIG LOL

Like, these lobsters if u put ur ankle in the claws wouldn't snap ur ankle? or don't they have that much strength in them? LOL this to me as an Englishman is another 'crazy wild animal' story from places that aren't the UK.
Did they just catch boy off the coast of New Jersey or the whole set?
Lobsters of this size were a lot less rare than they are these days due to changing tastes of Americans (lobster used to be 'prisoner food'). I encourage anyone curious about it to check out this 5 minute podcast! http://thememorypalace.us/2010/08/episode-33-lost-lobsters/
Just to add, they actually start out with 2 identical claws, which then get differentiated depending on whether the lobster is right or left handed. The thinner claw is more sensitive and faster, the thicker one is for crushing. [source](http://www.lobsters.org/ldoc/ldocpage.php?did=443)
Yup. Cutting and crushing.
Ones the crushed and ones to jerk off
They masturbate with the bigger claw
The big ones are the confidentiality claws and the little ones are the Santa claws. 

But seriously...both are males and (as someone prior posted) the large one is developed as they get older to crush, but biologists also believe that they are used to impress females. Here’s [one source] (http://www.lobsters.org/ldoc/ldocpage.php?did=443)
West Coast lobsters have identical claws. 
Actually no naturally-selected feature of any living thing has any purpose, exactly. It has survival value, but that is an emergent fact and not a purposeful development.
Lobstrosities indeed. 
Dod-a-chok?
I can always count on reddit to make this reference whenever a large lobster is posted. Thankee sai
And the gunslinger followed. Nice reference!
Long days and pleasant nights, sai.
Sounds Hawaiian, doesn't it?
over-fishing really depleted the population.
Ever since the pope created a boy season they are not growing to maturity
Ah, the old Reddit [Pope-a-roo](https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/8byl1w/is_this_really_necessary/dxbjwch/?context=10000)
They used to feed little boys to prisoners before they became considered a delicacy. 
Definitely read the title as “a boy mounted between two lobsters”

Those were the good ole days. That one looks like it might be under the limit for catch and keep though. Should have probably thrown it back.
I've heard the same. If you brought lobster to school for lunch you got teased for being poor.
That's because they were massively abundant and consumed to the point of being endangered in some places at one point, they have an unending lifespan and can grow continuously, most aren't this size anymore because we captured and are all the big ones. The whole northeast US fed it's coastal poor with lobster at one point, now it's $6-7/pound and we still have a crapload of them.
Yes, and also, when Puritans immigrated to new England, the shores were teaming with lobster, but they wouldn't eat them. Puritans had a very limited concept of diet. They would grind them up and use them as fertilizer. 

It's important to remember how many periods of starvation those settlers underwent. They truly were ill adapted to the new world, in part because they only wanted to eat and grow what they'd eaten and grown in England.
Same deal in New England.  Servants in the area had it in their contracts that they could NOT be fed lobster more than 4 times a week.  

We just didn't know very much about preparation back then, so lobster was terrible. The modern way of cooking lobster, live boil served with melted butter, only came about quite recently.  
One of my favorite things to do when moving somewhere new is to find the cheap local fish market. Chinese markets are great for this in the US

Then next time you feel like treating yourself / skipping out of work early, tell them you've gotta go, you have a lobster dinner planned

They'll ask what the occasion is. And with enough self love you could truly make it one! But really it's just a $5 crustacean boiled in tap water
They also used to be cooked completely differently. They used to basically grind them up, including a lot of their shell.
I've always heard this and it doesn't make sense to me.  I'm trying to think of a modern day equivalent, something we look down upon as for poor people but tastes amazing.  Why would rich people refuse to eat it if it tasted good?  
They're moving north in search of colder water as the Atlantic ocean warms up.
They must do. I mean, they both have big, meaty claws!
Lobsters, though not immortal... continue to grow until they die. They do not experience senescence like we do. They don’t get old and die from “old age”. 

In theory they could get so big they would suffocate from their own weight. Exoskeletons are not made to support extremely large animals. 

But, the molting process is very stressful. And most of the very old, very large ones die from stresses related to not being able to molt anymore. They basically get infections that cause scar tissue to adhere them to their shells and they die from being unable to continue to grow. 


In Maine, lobsters with a carapace measuring over 5 inches must be thrown back, as well as egg-bearing females and females known to bear eggs (their tails are marked by fisherman). In my two years working on lobster boats we probably caught around 10 lobsters close to this size, and who knows how large they get down there, at some point they simply wont fit into our traps! 
That would be fucking terrifying
Largest documented lobster caught was in 1977, weighing 44lbs and estimated to be 100 years old. 

Regulations for lobsters mean you have to throw back anything where the eye to carapace is less than 3 1/2" and more than 5". So basically the young ones and the big ones go free. We're not trying to catch them. And lobster traps are extremely inefficient anyway. Only 10% of lobsters that come across a trap will enter, and 94% of those that enter, leave. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_lobster#North_American_lobster_industry

So tell me, why do you think we are sucking here? Do you know if studies exist about the size of lobsters walking around? Are you thinking that because you never see large lobsters on the dinner table that it's because we already killed them all, not because it's illegal? 
#Are you sure you want that
Speak for your self I never killed no lobster.
I'm sure there are; there's a size limit these days so they throw back the huge ones!
Would you rather have 5-foot sea monster bugs terrorize you at the beach, or eat delicious sea monster bugs? Huh?
The lobster industry is generally regarded as a model for sustainability. For example the traps that we use allow something like 80-90%(not sure of the exact number) of lobster that enter to escape. And of course there is a ready food source in whatever bait we happen to be using. So we are dropping our traps and feeding *many* more lobsters than we are catching. Which is great as the majority can now grow and spawn. In that sense it's actually comparable to farming! Not to mention all the other regulations regarding size, which are strictly enforced. 
Would you REALLY want lobsters this size and plentiful? Imagine a world where you and your loved ones go swimming in a tiny window of summer in northern Maine because summer lasts like two weeks up there then the waters are frozen the rest of the year. You then risk losing body parts and your lives to one of these rock monsters...
It can't fail on a ten year old!
Right, crustaceans and insects are very closely related.  Insects are basically just crustaceans that eventually crawled up onto land.

https://sciencing.com/differences-between-crustaceans-insects-8118623.html
> Lobsters really are sea cockroaches.

You're right, and I always find it fascinating to think about what animals humans(Westerners) eat and which they don't.

I will pay $20 to dunk a sea crawling cockroach in butter and love it. But the idea of eating a dirt crawling cockroach repulses me to my core.

I eat Cows and Pigs and Lamb, but its repulsive to me to eat dog or cat. 

I eat Chicken, Turkey, Duck and Frogs, but any other but any other bird sounds gross and I wouldnt eat any other four legged slimy thing.
If you're allergic to eating shellfish/crustaceans you'll be allergic to eating cockroaches, too.
Cold water lobster do (like Maine lobsters), warm water lobsters do not (like Caribbean).
One for cutting one for crushing according to another comment 
Lobsters grow extremely slowly too, these might’ve been close to 100 years old 
Does age affect lobster meat like it does game? 


I seem to remember my uncle telling me that an old doe doesn’t have good meat; if that applies to lobster, too, what a complete and utter waste...
His room is impeccable 
This is the comment I was looking for
Photo caption: Claiming his rightful seat as the new Top Lobster
Interesting history note: lobsters weren’t always considered a luxury food. As you can see by how big these lobsters were able to grow, they were largely unharvested for a very long time and were so plentiful that poor folks could basically go to any beach on Long Island to catch a meal. Only problem was that was basically the equivalent of going out to catch enormous insects to eat (I mean, it still is when you really look at a lobster). The Depression spread humility to people’s food choices and also made people get creative with preparing their food; after the thirties, now more well-off folks who had developed a taste for lobster kept eating it leading to the growth of lobster farming and a history of lobster becoming a prominent luxury food
They were taken apart and meat cleaned out. The breaks are very important so you can put them back together. I used to have one just like this mounted on a board to hang up, it was 30-35lbs when it was alive. It was caught off the coast of Rhode Isalnd by my fathers lobsterman friend. It was always a massive talking point in the room.
One pinches, the other shreds. Orientation depends on gender. 

I's only been quite recent that humans have become sentimental about old things. Prior to that we were just like every other animal, trying to harvest the resources we needed for survival. Animals don't care if a lobster is old or not, they just want dinner. 
Who gives a shit about these old ass sea-roaches. Disgusting bugs. 
Do you have a source on that? I have never heard that, my aunt and uncle have been lobster fisherman forever and showed me how to differentiate gender, and this never came up. My understanding was that it was due to handedness.
Orientation of claws has nothing to do with gender. 
One for crushing you hand, and other to cut it clean off.
Because we caught and ate most of the big ones.

Big ones still exist, but they are more rare, and also depending on local laws fishermen are not allowed to keep the bigger ones, so you won't see them at your local restaurants even if they're out there in the ocean.
Yeah, they don't get old and have very few illnesses that can hurt them, so unless they are physically injured they will keep living and growing. The record was over 6 feet long I believe, that's larger than a person, that lobster was about 1000 years old if I recall.
So a light and heavy attack
This is interesting. I'm not strictly left or right handed, I use my left hand for precision tasks like writing or eating, and my right for power tasks such as throwing or sawing.

TIL I'm a lobster.
But if both hands have different purposes, how can we define it as right or left handed?
Lobsters.org!? 
One is a little bit Country, the other a lil' bit Rock-N-Roll
A lobster after my own heart, respect 
Hmm... is this true, fellow Redditors?
Dah-duh-chum? 
Long days, pleasant nights.
I guess some people took the 'fishers of men' thing a bit too literally.
Although you have to travel to different locations, lobsters are actually still in abundance.
I think you mean "over phishing" 😂
I think capitalism did that. If people only caught what they were going to eat it would not have gotten to the extent it is now. 
Hold my Bible, I'm going in.
I heard (from a lobsterman) that there are still big ones around. 

They use traps to catch them, and the holes are only so big. So if a lobster doesn't get trapped while it's the right size, they can't get into the traps anymore and keep growing.
Looking at $30 / lb or more on the west coast.  Dungenese crab can almost get affordable (he’ll I’ve caught them with my bare hands).
It's only $6-7 a pound out there? I would eat lobster every day if it was that cheap where I live.
How did they used to cook it? I mean, i throw a butterflied lobster tail right on the grill and its delicious. How do you mess that up?
Really?  That sounds terrible.  No one figured out how to steam one?
I think the poor people weren't getting fresh lobster. It was canned and, in the early days of canning, supposedly there were quality issues which gave lobster a bad rap.
Escargot? I don't want any GD snails! 
r/crazyideas build the perfect lobster enclosure and keep 2 in perfectly good health so they never stop growing.  In 700 years have them fight to the death, as giant lobster monsters.
So by eating them, we are actually doing them a favour 🙃
The only thing I remember about lobsters is that they have like 60 neurons. That's why lobster traps don't need to close, because they're too "dumb" to not just keep trying to walk forward
Wow, that's super fascinating. Thanks for sharing.
You say they don’t die from old age but.. that sounds like they can die from old age.
So after a while they are kind of like, “Human! See me! Eat me damn you!!”
Wait, why would you toss bigger lobsters? 
Similar laws in south Florida. 
Kinda like [These giant fuckers](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/1022x670+0+164/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F427c53d6e81343093615e76011d366c9%2F205858473%2FDNjoaxwU8AABgxw.jpg), who are big enough to kill [birds.](https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/09133133/img_1373-800x533.jpg)
Could i somehow become the next millionaire if i develop a more efficient lobster trap?
I don’t doubt you at all, I just have a question. Why do we toss the big ones back? Do they have more babies or? 
Those regulations haven't always existed and the reason that they do is because they were overfished for so long that protective measures became necessary.
I really doubt those regulations have existed for the past century.
Well, isopods are crustaceans that eventually crawled up on land. 
Well, if cockroaches were enormous, with giant legs to break off with meaningful chunks of meat to rip out and eat, and lived in the wild rather than trash heaps, we'd eat them too. I have no interest in eating lobster shell, or it's guts, or lobsters which grew up next to a sewage runoff. And that reasoning is the foundation for why I have no interest in eating cockroach. It's less irrational than some would purport it to be.
I can understand everything you said here except the part about finding any bird outside of turkey, chicken and duck gross. I mean I've heard people say they don't want to eat ostrich, or birds that nobody eats like crow, but you seriously telling me quail, or pheasant, or other various game birds you wouldn't eat? 
A friend of mine went to visit family a number of years ago, and the place where she's from was known for cooking dog as a delicacy. She tried it without thinking twice because she was curious about it, and she said that the dog meat has a really weird texture to it, and the meat is kind of pungent and has an off-putting flavor. I don't know what type of dog they used, but that might be one reason why we don't eat them. 
Maybe I'm being gullible, but is that true? How would we possibly know?
A light attack and a heavy attack according to another comment.
It does. Anything over 5lbs can be tough. But when these were caught, they were incredibly common and food for poor people. Nowadays regulations in the US prevent hauling in large lobsters like these. 

Yes you're exactly right and lobster used to be so large and plentiful back then it was considered a "poor" person's food!  Imagine?

He's facing dragons, bucko
He refuses to surrender linguistic territory!
Man they posed these next to a child to show how big they were.  They were proud to kill something unique and exceptional.
I'm pretty sure flavius here was speculating, not declaring.
They can’t crush or snip your hands, it just hurts like a bitch. They tend to get you with their quicker lighter claw which doesn’t hurt nearly as much. The crusher claw can give you a solid pinch though, and they don’t let go, they tighten when they feel you pulling.
 more ones for holding/crushing one for manipulating food too the mouth/ cutting
Yeah, gotta go play God of War now...
The faster weapon goes in your off-hand when dual-wielding.
You might also be immortal, but you don't wanna check that one!
Which do you ~~beat~~ crush  your meat with?
Dude, I'm the same way. There are dozens of us!
I'm the same but I still consider myself left handed.
It's called mixed handedness or cross-dominance, and I'm that way too!
::three fingers tapped on throat::
May you have twice as many.

If the clergy really had faith, they'd be at the Pride events trying to get people to come to events.

>"Which of the two did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.

Matthew 21:31
Yeah, now with all that regulations and licenses stuff.
yeah, but no one boys 
Humans completely eradicating and hunting other species to extinction was going on long before capitalism.

There were giant beavers, all sorts of bird species, and mastodons in North America 11,000 years ago. There were giant Moa in New Zealand 400 years ago. There were megamammals like giant sloths in South America 12,000 years ago.

All of these places had semi-recent human inhabitants. None had capitalism.
So did people not eat the lobsters that were caught? 
So non capitalist countries utilize common resources better?  
It’s called planning ahead, if you can catch tomorrow’s food too, why not? 
Probably lobster baked bean casserole or lobster jello. People back then were dumb.
I have read that they would grind it up into a porridge, meat and shell together.
Preserved. Lobster goes bad fast and they weren't going out to get a fresh one every day to eat
Maybe they thought you had to eat the shells
It needs to be fresh.  Either throw it in the pot still alive, or freeze it directly after the kill.  The fat from butter also adds a lot and they didn't understand that aspect either.
This is just conjecture on my part, but I think there was a number of factors beyond just not knowing how to cook them. At the time the food was meant for poor people (especially workers- factories and other places would do really large cooks for all the workers) and so keeping things as low effort (and thus cost) as possible was a high priority. Then because the food was known as being poor people's food there was no incentive for cooks to figure out how to cook it well because the people who could actually afford the effort saw it as beneath them.
In HG Wells’ book the Time Machine, I recall he gets transported millions of years in the future and there’s nothing but monolithic crustaceans walking around.  My memory is fuzzy though.  It was a cool scene!
I swear on everything that I am that my band mates brother is fucking crazy and has a pool outside that he constantly maintains to keep his crabs in. He raises crabs and has a crazy idea to solve world hunger. His brother said it like he was ashamed. 
I bet they aren't even appreciative of that fact. Ungrateful ingrates. 
I'll melt some butter.
The same thing can be said of white tail deer. If we didn’t hunt then, they would eat and breed themselves into starvation. We also hunted the predators down 150 years ago, which is why there is no natural balance. 
We’re doing them a marvelous *flavor*
Yes, I think we would all choose *boiled alive* as our preferred death.
Most lobsters walk in and back out of the traps easily, they get trapped when they get spooked and retreat into the parlor, which they can’t get out of easily.
Death by Illness is not cellular senescence in the true sense. 

They don’t die from dna damage caused by replicative senescence. In humans this is also known as the Hayflick limit. Replicative senescence is the result of telomere shortening. 

The longer a organism lives the higher the probability of accidental or illness death overtime. 

So, even if they were truly immortal... eventually they would succumb to accident or illness anyway. 
Larger females hold significantly more eggs under their tails, I suppose larger lobster make better breeding stock as well. 
so they can breed I assume.
Diane Cowan, a senior scientist at The Lobster Conservancy in Friendship, said large lobsters need to be protected because they produce more offspring.

“They are proven survivors, which makes them more important to the gene pool,” she said.
Bigger lobsters are reproductive lobsters.
I assume there is an ideal size for lobsters to be eaten.  Too small is no good and too big is no good.  Also, if you let the big ones keep mating and eat only the average ones, then possibly by natural selection the local lobster population will get bigger which is better for everyone.  :D
Also the bigger the lobster the worse it tastes 
They're not very good for eating and are capable of producing more offspring, so it's a net benefit for everyone if you toss them back.
So they have large baby lobsters. 

If you only take the big ones, only small ones have kids. That over generations means a generally smaller animal. 
Even an American can't eat that much.
Tell me that's not real 
That is absolutely horrific; I’d have a goddamned heart attack finding that monster on my fucking garbage can. 😳
He's probably scavenging that bird though. They're not quick. 
Coconut crabs are tough enough to be a mono-fighting type Pokemon. That's right, a Pokemon based on a "coconut crab" that has neither water, bug, nor grass typing.

It evolves into an abominable snowman/coconut crab hybrid if it levels up on the same mountain that the Elite Four is on, which is super inconvenient if you want to actually have it on your team.
Nah, see, that needs to die. 
If you stuck your hand in it's claw, could it break your hand?
My uncle would dive for lobsters and put his finger out as bait. I'm sure it was efficient but I don't think he's a millionaire.
Yes, lobsters get more fertile as they age. 
Probably tough and/or strange tasting meat like a lot of animals when they age past a certain point. No one likes chewy meat. 
>[Now to the meat of the matter: what happens when people actually eat insects? One study compared field crickets with fresh water scampi, and found the same allergens present in each one. The cricket had an extra one; a protein which causes allergies that also occurs in crustaceans – and cockroaches! So basically: lots of crossover between bug and sea-creature…](http://www.bugsfeed.com/edible_insects_allergy)

I heard about this on Joe Rogan's podcast. Apparently when he was on Fear Factor they made some people eat cockroaches, and someone that had a shellfish allergy had to be taken to the hospital.
A *slippity* and a *slappity* according to another comment.
But if we round up all the small ones how will they even get large? 
>  But when these were caught, they were incredibly common and food for poor people.

Fun fact. 100 years ago lobster was thought of as a trash meat, and was dirt cheap and fed to the poor as charity. 
I saw one that was at least 30lbs in a tank at a restaurant in Boston. He was a mamoth compared to all the other lobsters. His claw was bigger than the next largest one.
Pretty sure it was used as prison food
If I’m remembering correctly this is because it was served the the poor all mashed up, shell and all. 
I knew that—lobster was served in prison, along with cooked rat. 
I think that has more to do with not being able to keep them fresh for very long. Like most fish unless you keep the meat frozen it goes bad extremely fast. 
It’s actually more plentiful now, we’ve killed all its competition and we’re fishing them much more sustainably. Lobster was poor persons food because they hadn’t figured out a way to distribute them fresh, and there was no market for them.
Yeah cus it was a lot of food?
So a light and heavy attack
They have other smaller claws used for eating.  The two bigger claws are used for offense/ defense. 
Gonna make me plug in the ps3
He'll find out eventually. *In the end, there can be only one!!!*
Oh to live in a time of giant beavers and mastodons.


True, but the rate of species extinction we are currently seeing (as much a result of air pollution and plastic pollution in the ocean) is unprecedented. It’s nof fair to simply blame capitalism, but pretending that “this is how it’s always been”
Is ignoring the sheer scale of species death currently going on. For some perspective, 150-400 species are going completely extinct per day, in what is quite possibly the largest species die off since the dinosaurs.
Lobster used to be prison food.

Actually, at least on the west coast, wasteage was a giant problem 100 years ago. People digging clams would very often injure or kill the clam in the process, and as a result would simply throw them away. Same would be done with small clams, or really anything but a large, perfect clam.

Idk if that ever happened with lobster but I spent a quarter studying history of clamming so I just feel compulsed to talk about it when I can 
Yeah, that would do it.
Hey, at least he's trying to put his crazy to good productive use. 

But he should be told world hunger isnt because of lack of food. Its because of the logistics of food distribution to those who need it.
Ungrateful invertebrates!
I'm dumb but how do you eat yourself into starvation?
Natural balance includes us. We are apart of that balance. We have been hunting both predators and deer for hundreds of thousands of years. To say the reason there is no balance is because of a lack of predators is to simplfy the issue. Almost every state has predators, save for Hawaii. 
That’s not true. Our suburbs have helped them more than anything. 

The reason it’s not true I read in The Selfish Gene about DNA knowing somehow when the carry capacity has been roughly met. 
It's common courtesy to put a knife through the head before you toss them in the water.
Not sure if boiled to death to death of torn apart alive would be much different.
But this “illness” is directly related to their age. So I see what you’re saying, it’s not telomere shortening... buuuut it’s still kind of dying from old age. 
They also don’t taste as good when they get huge 
What about larger males?

They said any oobster over 5 inches gets thrown back (I assume 5 inches wide).
This makes a lot of sense and should be the first thing one should notice. Nice.
Correct, larger, older lobsters tend to be tougher than the mid range ones. 
That's a [coconut shell crab](https://youtu.be/eXQCcEM9MEc), which gets its name from being able to crack a coconut shell. They eat almost anything, including kittens and rats.
It's not real (but actually it is)
Coconut Crabs are very real.  The bird is some kind of boobie i think. 

So he only get to fail 11 times.
Ah, that’s why we don’t keep the big cat fish were I live. 
No it's because the big ones can make asstons of eggs and by letting those live, they will make thousands more little ones.
Lobsters dont age. They dont die of old age. They also dont stop growing. 

Lobsters die on our dinner plate, on another animals dinner plate or from the stresses placed on them during molting and the size/pressures of having an exoskelton as such a large creature. 

But they do not age like other animals.
Ah ok, fair enough. Thanks! 
If we did catch “all the small ones” then there wouldn’t be more to reproduce.
It could only be served a certain number of times a week aswell, as serving it anymore was seen as being too cruel.
One for snippedy one for snappedy.
Hhhheeere wee are, born to be to kings
I can't speak to mastodons, but there were giant beavers aplenty when I was in college.
“This is how it’s always been” does not dismiss or ignore the problem of human caused climate change and mass extinction. It provides a better platform for understanding the scope of the problem.

Environmental problems will not suddenly be solved by a different form of government or economic model. Very real change to behavior, through laws, individual awareness, and international agreements, is how we can address this.

The root problem of extinction is not capitalism. To claim so is to be in complete ignorance of history.
> For some perspective, 150-400 species are going completely extinct per day

How are those estimates calculated, and are they calculated by people who have agendas?
Also NYC wasn't always the big apple, it used to be big [oyster](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2011/06/01/history-half-shell-intertwined-story-new-york-city-and-its-oysters)
Which enlightened institution of higher learning offers “history of clamming”?
He’s training the crabs to walk to places where people are hungry 
Inveterate invertebrates!
Ingrateful Unvertebrates
The population expands so wildly without a higher level predator that they eat all their own food away, and scarcity causes a mass episode of  starvation 
ever eat your pantry empty and not have enough cash to make it until pay day so you just kind of make cheese slices with mustard on it for meals for awhile?  Animals do that too.  Only pay day is the rainy season.
Wild pigs also destroy *everything* and are probably the most invasive species in North America. Their only predator is mountain lions which is why in my neck of the woods in Northern California there’s actually a lot of mountain lions. In Hawaii, they have to be hunted or they will destroy vast swaths of land. They also taste good. 
Yes. We are part of the balance. But with the invention of the rifle and vast improvements and accessibility to it. We are now able to tip the scale heavily in our favor. I’ve never hunted with black powder. But I have shot a coyote from 100 yards, it knew I was there but didn’t perceive a threat because I wasn’t near him. 
I do not agree that ‘Suburbs helped them more than anything’ 
Lobsters have different nervous systems than humans.  They have several nerve centers spread throughout their bodies and a knife through the head will leave them intact.  
Couldn't tell you, still alive.  Though burn victims usually say it's the most excrutiating thing ever, and people who lose limbs often say they didn't feel it happen.  I'm thankful for neither so far.
There is no need to put “illness” in quotes. Shell disease is most definably an illness.   

And I assumed we were all going to not be so pedantic. It was apparently an incorrect assumption. 

Yes, it is related to aging. They don’t from what we colloquially refer to in humans as “dying from old age” which is cellular senescence. I am sorry if I was too confusing in my explanation. 
Just like almost everything else
When judging whether a lobster is legal to harvest, only the length of the carapace is accounted for. The carapace is the section of shell between the lobsters eye sockets and the beginning of  the tail. Larger males make better breeding stock not only because they are far more successful at competing for mates,  but they are also better equipped to protect the females when they molt, when mating occurs. 
Are they good eating?
This might be a weird question, but it that woman wearing a raincoat indoors while reporting the story? I can't be the only person who is confused.
The bird is already dead and being eaten, no need to add insult to injury.
So then why can’t we get the large ones?
That's because it wasn't lobster prepared as we know it and served with butter.  It was ground up, shell and all, and served.  There was also a lack of refrigeration at the time. 

Let your mind wander with that. 
One for clickety one for clackity 🎺🎺
one protec, one attac
Clicker and clacker is the scientific term for dominant and non-dominant claws respectively on crabs.
A ones for a pinching and a ones for a crushing
So a light and heavy attack
Ok pal for one I live in a place that ever since time immemorial has been defined by clamming

And for you it's in Washington state so I'm sure you can guess. Go ahead and talk shit there's literally nothing I haven't heard before 
Equilibrium would be found if all other variables of nature were also left undisturbed; e.g., wolves. 
And that’s where we come in

PBS had a documentary on deer that covered this extensively too. Thanks for the downvotes. 
Hey hey don’t worry. Im sorry if I got you fluffled. I didn’t think a shell being too heavy was an illness. I just think it’s interested what we call dying of old age and what we don’t call it that
Apparently, yes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_crab#Relationship_with_human_beings
Oh yeah they gotta be. Their meat cant be a whole lot different than that of commercially available crab meat but are massive
Actually I don’t think it’s dead yet. There’s a video on r/natureismetal of this whole ordeal and if I remember correctly the bird is still alive as more crabs come join the party and eat it :(
Lobster breeding rates grow exponentially with size. The start breeding at about 3/4lb, but a 5lber produces 100s of times more eggs than the 3/4lber. 
They exist. It’s against the law and the cages used to catch the lobsters are built for small and medium sized ones
So a light and heavy attack 
One for something, one for something else 
One for Piccadilly one for hillabilly
Dad-a-chum Did-a-chick?
So a light and heavy attack
But most important, one tasty snac
Ok buddy, I was trying to be cute, but I was serious. I love razors, and I'm fond of Gray's Harbor, if that's where you mean?

Some of my earliest memories are of going to spend the weekend at my great-grandmother's house in Hoquiam. We'd have a nice dinner, then get up the next morning at the crack of dawn and go clamming. That was late 70's / early 80s before the red tides...

If not Gray's Harbor area, where do you mean? I always associated the history of the Grays Harbor area more with logging than with clamming?
I don't think they were talking shit. They sound genuinely curious.
Yeah but many areas no longer have any wolf population at all. And that equilibrium comes after ecological collapse. So we hunt them.
Yeah turns out noone wanted a pack of wolves in their backyard so we got rid of them. 
It’s Reddit. I really shouldn’t be that surprised. 

The shell getting too big isn’t the illness I was referring to. Maybe you should take some time to reread my comment. It might clear up some confusion. 

Colloquial language is always interesting. Populations of humans understanding common language is a study all in itself. 
> Thomas Hale Streets reports a trick used by Micronesians of the Line Islands to get a coconut crab to loosen its grip: "It may be interesting to know that in such a dilemma a gentle titillation of the under soft parts of the body with any light material will cause the crab to loosen its hold."[35]

Apparently, they're ticklish
Like goat, it depends what they've been eating. 
I think we're on to something here guys, dont stop
One for snippedy one for snappedy.

A rat-a-tat-tat if you would
So a light and heavy attack
One for finkfinckedy and one for dinkdinckedy.
Yeah, I don't think of anywhere in Washington state when I think of clams. New England, sure, but Washington state? 

Maybe I had a sheltered childhood or something...

You're gonna talk shit because I go to Evergreen lol 

Yep, I'm a Grays Harbor clam digger myself! I'm actually on the beach typing this, about to be digging, so wish me luck. Awesome to meet a guy on here who's in on the secret, evidently the other guy doesn't even know we have clams ;)
That’s true, but it was kind of the wolves’ backyard first. 
righty tighty, lefty loosey
So a light and heavy attac
One for the diggity and one for the dootigty
One for light and heavy attack. Ima throw in a special at the end, tailwhip!
Razor clams are one of Washington State's best kept secrets.
Good luck to you! I live in SF now, but get back up to WA and go clamming around New Years.  I grew up on Lacey / Olympia and have some very fond (and blurry) memories of Evergreen from my HS & college days. I went to WSU. I guess it shouldn't be a surprise that Evergreen offers a quarter course on the history of clamming in WA!

I assume Geoducks figure in as well? When I was growing up, I was told they weren't good eating, but I've since been to enough Chinese seafood restaurants here in the BA to know that was a lie!
So a light and a heavy attack 
One for snatchin', one for smashin'. 
So, a light and heavy attack?
"Best kept secrets"

That's why I've never heard of it, then.
