posts picture of cat
 lol.
I, too, name my cat pictures as homework. 
Lol! This is my Lyft and Uber profile picture. Every time I get in the car this picture pops up before they approve my ride and start driving. I get a lot of questions/giggles/ or hesitations haha. It's great. Sometimes I try to smile like the cat when they look back at me through the mirror. 
Is that Ryuka?
Obviously fake, but still good
First meirl I actually laughed out loud at.
Anyone have the image of the cat? 
Ugh. Canvas.
This is an actual fear of mine. Hahahaha. I always triple check when submitting my resume or something. I can just see myself submitting some dumb ass meme. 
Wrong file format 
üôÄ
only a noob doesn't have their disc drive partitioned into meme-world and work-world
Isn't this an unethical life hack for students? Save an image as .docx and submit it. Professor can't open the file because it's "corrupted", giving your dead-ass extra time to actually write the essay.

Fake and gay
Where can i find the original photo of that cat 
Why is a picture of a cat:

a) Called "Literacy Essay 1"?

b) Saved as a .docx file?

c) Showing up as a picture if it's saved as a .docx instead of an image file?
Cat.
No real and homosexual
Lmao, I love this picture. What's the story behind the cat weird smiling? üòπ
A+
Why is it a .docx file?
[here's the cat if anyone wants it](https://i.imgur.com/0PzsRBM.jpg)
Is this funny to some people? Doesn't the obvious fakenesa detract from that? Come on guys 
Being a teacher, if I would have received that picture instead of an essay, it would have made my day. Gold star for you, sir or madam. 
Well goodbye /r/meirl it‚Äôs been real
Lol‚Äôd irl, almost did this before üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Fuck canvas
As a college professor, it would be a welcomed change from poorly written paragraphs. 
Fake as fuck but it is funny as hell
I thought this was gonna be a dick pick .... What have you done to me reddit!
Um that's a docx file ü§î
Brightspace is shit
This cat is cheesing on molly

8KB picture

Mhmm
First thing I noticed haha
When I was about 7 yo, I copy-pasted the pictures I wanted to save into a .doc, because I didn't know how to download them.
You can rename file extensions.

The real issue is that it's not a PDF.
I used to do this when I needed more time to finish the paper. Usually I'd submit a rough draft and pretend like I submitted the wrong one and once I submitted a blank word file and acted confused when the professor asked me about it.

If you pretend you don't really get computers shit like this works 
Some uploading thingies will show the contents of what you uploaded in a little preview. So in theory they could have saved just the picture of that cat.
To be fair, these uploader things for assignments usually work like that. You usually have more than one thing that can be described as "Literary essay" so you use something else and change its name when you upload it.
Literacy Essay, more like Blind-Test essay
I save all my pictures as .docx files
Everyones roasting you on "alot" but im genuinely interested in what a human would look like making this face

Come on..who's gonna link me that picture so that I can use it?
Hey, Maximus2005, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

you got a link to the picture my guy?
I thought the whole point of the picture of the driver was so they could verify that they are getting in the right car. I would never get into the car of a person who would hide who they are, even if it's just a funny picture.
~~Tomo~~ Ryuka buddy what's wrong?
Cursed image
I didn‚Äôt. Why would an image be saved as a .docx and be 8kb big? I hope somebody was fired for this blunder. 
But not the first fake one.
Hahahahahahahaha haha totally??!!!!

Or something worse.. 
Like a pic of my skin collection
Could‚Äôve renamed the file to .docx
boi who cares
What do you mean, memes are my job?
meme-world and world-world
Might work with some profs but I always had to submit paper copies as well as the online submissions. 

I used to "corrupt" files in high school all the time though. 
My school has google drive with revision history so you can't slip anything past them
There are actually file corruption websites designed for this purpose. I made use of them couple of times back in school when I was a little behind on something or found out something was due that I hadn't completed. You just upload a word file (can be empty) and then it will corrupt it. Then you send it to your teacher. This way of doing it means there's no change of them finding out it's just a renamed image file, since it's actually a corrupted document.
My school doesn‚Äôt care it the teacher can‚Äôt open the file. If they can‚Äôt open it, it‚Äôs late.
Gay and fake.

It might be possible since the picture is so blurry and monochromatic, but the smoking gun is the docx format.
As opposed to?
When I was 7 I wanted a Lite Brite. Get off my lawn.
When I was 7 I hand wrote in a notebook the HTML code for a game I wanted to put on my website, because I didn't know how to copy and paste. It didn't even work when I typed it back out.
Lots of the time you're supposed to submit docx files so the markers can add comments easily.

I don't believe it for a second but I still literally lol'd, the image is just too funny.

This has to be one of the, if not the best cat picture in the world, prove me wrong, you won't. 
Needs more jpeg

This gave me freshman flashbacks 
I would always just open the .docx in notepad and delete a ton of shit from the middle. Save it and boom corrupted file

It being a .jpg since the picture is the full document. Can‚Äôt believe I felt the need to respond lol
You can add comments to pdf
no institution worth its salt requires .docx files
Neat thing about docx it's just a zipped series of XML files. rename one to .zip and open it, you'll see.
That looks nothing like it

Well that worked well. 
That makes more sense, although I feel like I would be scared of a passenger who was trying to circumvent a security measure like that.
Cat, you chew that cord I'll... chew your cord!
No. This is a very important issue.
So did public lynchings. You'd have to have a bad sense of humor.
Its fake and gay. If it made you laugh you are fake and gay.
