“What do you want to be when you grow up”

Im assuming grad school is grievous firing up
>Actually naming yourself General___Reposti

You are a bold one.
Is it just the prevalence of these sorts of memes, or does the current generation of young college kids have a real burgeoning problem with mental health? Did the previous generation have the same problem?
General Reposti!
You always were Repost Scum
Work: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Your username fits you well
GENERAL REPOSTI! YOU ARE AN OLD ONE! 
I WANT EVERY USER WE HAVE TO DOWNVOTE THAT MAN.
You think college is bad, wait till you get into medical school. 
Haven't gotten into college.


Oh boi can't wait to drown in student loans
Take that ridiculous repost off this sub
I’ve always thought about at what age/grade to people give up on their dreams?
Like in grade 6 I remember kids saying they want to be a cop, doctor, engineer, lawyer and thennn at some point most of them don’t want to/ or go to college. 
General reposti
It’s sad because it’s a repost and your name is GENERAL REPOSTI 
Just wait for the tedium of life after college - try to make friends when you don’t have like minded people shoved into a room with you

Grad school is wearing Darth Vader's suit, designed to make him more miserable and angry all the time
Depression rates are rising among young people: http://time.com/4572593/increase-depression-teens-teenage-mental-health/

This is probably a combination of increasing awareness and an increasing actual problem 

Feels like it. People constantly make jokes about killing themselves or wanting to die or how awful life seems. I know two people who killed themselves within five months of each other. Also, I’ve switched from buying Xanax off my depressed friend to seeing a psychiatrist finally. This probably sounds super dramatic, but yeah you might have a point. Or maybe I live in a sad bubble. 
I mean economically younger people are worse off that definitely plays part in it. 
Pretty sure it’s just because Reddit is full of misfits. I mean just look at the number of people here who thought high school was the worst 2 years of their life. 
eh I thought we were just joking. 
But for me, if I don't work my ass off before exams, I'll actually be miserable
Not in college (17) but I've had depression for the last 3 years or so, and a few of my friends do too. It's definitely common.
Ella there 
Can we get r/GeneralReposti

Search your feelings bro. You know it to be true fam

his name is a dead giveaway
People complain alot about the most small & insignificant things in the US especially in my profession, where you're expected to "suck it up"
Hang on. The second panel is Kylo. She do you gain super powers in grad school? Or are YOU getting choked?
Grad school is Chewie watching Han die...just like my hopes and dreams. 
Grad school is... is there a moment in any of these films where a character gets hit in the balls with a sledgehammer for four years?
He also force withdraws all the money from your bank account.
Oh, I like this one better.
The world is more depressing for young adults today than it was 30 years ago, not because people are actually that much worse off but because of culture. We are indoctrinated by the media to believe that in order to not be a "failure," high school students need to be popular, straight As, go to college for four years, straight As, get a job, buy a house, family, etc. To somebody going through the changes that puberty brings and trying to figure out exactly what kind of person they want to be, it can be extremely stressful. When you feel like a single slip up will make you a failure at life, it's easy to fall into a spiral of depression, which then causes you to make bad decisions and creates a never ending cycle.

I went through something like this in my third year of uni after changing my major. My parents never once told me that I had a lot to live up to, and they were always supportive of me, but they were pretty powerless to prevent me from getting this idea in my head that I had to do everything perfectly otherwise be a "failure." I was convinced that every potential employer for the rest of my life would go through my entire history with a fine-tooth comb. "Oh, he got a D in linear algebra so we can't hire him. Instead we'll hire this guy who actually isn't a fuck up." Comparing your self to an impossible person who has never made a mistake in his life can be pretty disheartening.

The completely flawed idea that there exists a "perfect human being" and we should strive to be that person saturates the media. Television and movies have "role model" characters that set unreachable standards. The news is apparently now makes fun of people who don't get into their top college. Advertisers use rhetoric that plays with our inferiority complexes (use our name brand cologne and you can be just like this successful businessman who has sex with his secretary) to sell products. Human nature is to be competitive, which is okay to a degree, but because of our new interconnectedness and awareness of the state of the world caused by the rise of the internet, it has created a very toxic environment to come of age in. Society will never change until we stop trying to quantify having a "successful" life and stop comparing ourselves to our neighbors. We have a long way to go.
Also increase in diagnoses, I'm sure.
Nah i'm depressed, my gf is depressed, one of my housemates who I only knew through mutual friends moved out and left uni because of depression. One of my best friends almost killed himself. Idk what it is but the world seems bleak for a lot of people atm.

Hey, WarBloodXyo, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Yes.
You learn to manipulate the law but you choke on your debt and soul on the way. 
Grad school = Kylo
Hux = me
To add on your take, I think this generation lives in the shadow of the 08 recession, where they've seen their older peers struggling with student loans and unemployment, which is just pushing that much harder for perfectionism. 
Also, snowflake syndrome where they're coddled brats being exposed to the real world where their personal opinions are small and generally worthless despite the likes they receive on Twitter and Facebook.

It's a mild form of culture shock but constant, however it is severe when the victim suffers from progressive supremacist syndrome and they have a pathological inability to accept that their worldview is rejected by the majority of the world.

edit: LOL
How did this happen? We're smarter than this...
How did this happen? They should be [smarter](https://www.reddit.com/r/SequelMemes/comments/873vfh/what_do_you_want_to_be_when_you_grow_up/?st=JG9GZT9G&sh=727622c1) than this!

I don't conflate progressivism with millenials.
There are only two genders.
Ironically he could be describing red hats.
You very much do. You ranted about progressives when we were all having a normal conversion about millenials.
Lol.
