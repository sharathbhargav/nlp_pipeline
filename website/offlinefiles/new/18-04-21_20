r/bossfight
Yup. I sometimes feel like unsubing but then shit like this pops up and I’m happy I stayed.
Yeah... I'm just scrolling and see all these things about Avicii and then this....

/r/HybridTranimals?
hmmmm

It’s a photoshop.
I really hoped that this would be a thing.

At first I didn't like his new song, "Work," but it's grown on me a bit. It's a real banger. 
Ulpt: the great ones make it to r/all
He's not your friend, buddy.
Gr8 b8 I rate 5 and one eighth out of eight
I suppose you are as well, i mean you took the time to tell him an opinion no one asked for..
hmmmmm
Usually the complete opposite for most subs 
Unethical LPT:

Repost from /r/all in order to reshare the great ones for new subscribers.
He’s not your buddy, guy.
Hmmmmmm 
He's not your guy, pal.
Hmmmmmmm
He's not your pal, dude.
He's not your dude, compatriot
He's not your compatriot, amigo
He's not your amigo, mate
He's not your mate, bro.
