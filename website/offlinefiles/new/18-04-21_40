Dom doet Avicii

As a Swede who has lived in Utrecht and partied to Aviciis music there this is amazing and touching at the same time. Thanks for a beautiful commemoration. 
Now I'm sad :(
Swede coming from /r/all

This was amazing, utterly stunning. Someone must be really talented with those bells.
Wonderlijk dat er iemand opstaat en zegt; dit gaan we doen vandaag!
Die glasbak tussendoor geeft ook een leuk effect
I'm tearing up over here. Beautiful tribute \<3 RIP avicii
What an honor. He would've loved this! 
Ik vind het vooral heel tof dat deze kerk er al sinds de 13/14e eeuw staat en nu dit speelt. Honderduizenden mensen hebben honderduizenden keren die klok horen luiden door de eeuwen heen. Maar vandaag klinkt Avicii. 
English comment coming through, is this real? If so, Thats amazing.
Ik heb trouwens ook nog ‘hey brother’ als daar interesse voor is. 
Very awesome, RIP
Why can‘t every place in the world be as amazing as the Netherlands? 
Leuk dat ze dat hebben gedaan, erg zonde 28 jaar pas.
What a beautiful tribute. That song gives me the feels normally, but given what's happened, and how it's presented here, made me tear up straight away.
Voor wie minder bekend is met haar werk, dit is stadsbeiaardier [Malgosia Fiebig] (https://twitter.com/malgosiafiebig). Niet de eerste keer ook dat er bekendere nummers over de grachten galmen: zie onder meer [David Bowie] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mgwVzZAclo), [Radiohead] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUV-sUbI4GQ), [Pink Floyd] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bGPkfk0Fas), [Abba] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_JchFc3jDU)... Soms als eerbetoon bij overlijden, vaak genoeg ook gewoon omdat het kan.

EDIT: Het carillon van de Domtoren heeft ook gewoon zijn eigen [YouTube-kanaal] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZHt_oQLv_5HM-S3lksWCJQ). 
I have a cousin of mine in Mexico City who I only get to see once every 5 years and I remember us listening to “Hey Brother” and being able to connect immediately despite the cultural differences. Avicii played a huge role in my life for sure. 
Swedish person here, saw this post on r/all. It’s very heart touching to hear this. I just want to say thank you Netherlands for being so awesome, thank you for doing such a great tribute for such a great artist, that has now unfortunately passed away.
Mooi eerbetoon! Klinkt ook erg goed trouwens
What a beautiful act of compassion. 

The Netherlands never ceases to amaze me.
Ontzettend mooi dit gebaar. Respect voor ze. Ik vind nog steeds heel moeilijk om te geloven dat Avicii is overleden. Zijn muziek introduceerde mij EDM muziek jaren geleden. Heb zo vaak geluisterd.

Rust in vrede, Tim :(
That was amazing. I felt every note. RIP Avicii. Much love from America. The world of music lost one of the greats today. 
Dankjewel /u/Bafkonijn!
Ik zat op het terras, supertof om te horen 
Een heel mooi eerbetoon. Ik heb een aantal weken toevallig zijn documentaire gezien die nu ook op Netflix staat. Die jongeman werd zo geleefd. 
Wat ontzettend zonde van zo’n jong leven.

Damn, this is good.
That was so nice started to cry immediately
American checking in. The Netherlands is awesome and so was Avicii. Rest In Peace. 
:(
Fuck man.. the feels
Anyone have a list of the songs?
That gave me chills. What a nice tribute. Just another reason I can’t wait to visit NL again. 
This is one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever heard, what a wonderful way to show respect to a man. 
Came here from /r/all just to say that I'm not crying, **YOU'RE CRYING!**. 😭
So much respect for him. Rip brother. I consider myself lucky to see your live gig here in Istanbul. Once again rest in peace buddy :( :( 

Also so much respect to the Netherlands. You guys are thoughtful. 
Ik woon in Utrecht en net als ze dit doen Ben ik met familie in Castricum. Is verdomme kut dat ik dit nu mis. Wel echt mooi. Dank voor de post en RIP Avicii...
rip 













**Nice clock tho**
Mooi eerbetoon, triest verhaal. Wat een ontzettende meezingers en fluiters zijn het ook.
R.I.P. :(
This is so touching to watch, RIP.
Hey, non-dutch (Finnish) person here. That's absolutely beautiful. 
American from /r/all. I know what this is and who plays the bells thanks to Wintergatan! 
Rest easy bro! Even though you were mainstream, your hidden emotion and messages in your music WERE heard and felt! I used to scream "Hey Brother" at 3am while riding my quad bike to get the cows ready for milking. There was something about this song that just gave me goosebumps til the end of the song and made me want to scream it, alone in a paddock with 600 cows seemed the right time. Much Love and Light Avicii!!!
So sad :(
This is beautiful. Rest in peace.
pure respect
Ah, Utrecht is such a beautiful city, I got to go there about a month ago and already want to go back 
Rest in peace Tim,
You were truly one of a kind. 
I hate that it took your death to make me rediscover how much i loved your music. 
Ill never stop listening. 
Ill show it to my children. 
The world is a quieter place with you gone. 
Ill never forget the first time that I heard Levels, Wake Me Up, Silhouettes. 
Your music made me a better person, made me enjoy small things in life. 
We’ve come a long way since that day. 

Sincerely a sadden fan. 
I’m not going to lie, seeing this first thing In the morning not only made me extremely happy, it sent chills down my body. 
can someone translate the title? google translate claims it says "stupid does avicii"
great tribute. 
/u/ShayGoes2Work they did Avicii at the Dom Tower in Utrecht today
This is so touching! I wish he were here to see this. RIP :(
Edit: so
What the name of the song?
Work so hard that when you die, the bells play your tune..
Rip tim
That's very nice of you \<3 /Swede
This is sad news, love you guys. From this Canadian guy. He spoke a lot to me with his music and I have been listening to everything all day and night.
Wat een toeval, in Hasselt vandaag deed de beiaardier hetzelfde. Mooi eerbetoon!
As a huge house fan, I want to go to the NL so bad. 
Amazing
Hey guys, what was the second song? (After Hey Brother)
Onze Lieve Vrouwetoren in Amersfoort speelde ook een paar Avicii nummers
This is so cool amd heartwarming
Vila i frid.❤️
This is incredible 
😢
This was beautiful thank you. 
This made me cry :/
This is one of these tributes I think it should be made when the person was alive! Freaking awesome.
Dankjewel.  I had never listened to this talented young man before I heard of his passing.  I listened to "Wake Me Up" for the first time directly before  watching this video.

What a terrible loss. My heart broke a little.
How did they practice this without anyone even noticing?  Absolutely amazing!
Dankjewel bafkonijn
Wow 
❤️
Thank you for this:)
Made me tear up. Amazing. 
RIP legend. I will always be greatful for your music
I'm crying 
I didn't even really like his music as I'm not a huge fan on his genre, but even so I still notice talent when I see it. I love music as an artform and can tell this guy touched a lot of people's lives with his talent and to me that is worth being respected for even if I wasn't a fan. This is a really dope tribute. RIP
I know this is so dumb, could anyone remind me the title of the song?
I was is Utrecht the day after David Bowie died and they played Major Tom, it was super cool! 
Now that's awesome. Respect! I wasn't a big fan of most of his work but this is very touching. 
Thats so fucking cool!
What song is playing on the church bells? It's beautiful, I just can't recognize it.
No you're crying 
Thank you from Sweden, this is absolutely beautiful.
Dit is de mooiste ding dat heb ik vandaag gezien. RIP Avicii. Hij ging veel te jong.
God damn, a year ago a close friend passed and we played avicii at his funeral and now avicii himself is gone. Life sucks sometimes.
I live in the wrong country.
Who died? This entire thread and most of the comments in English are just R.I.P. I gather it was a musician, but I don’t know the song. Where they from the Netherlands? 
May he Rest In Peace 
He will be missed 

Coming from r/all... His death was the first celeb death that saddened me.. and this tribute is excellent. Thank you Netherlands, this is amazing. So powerful.
Armin van buren commented that Avicii was the Mozart of our time and I couldn’t agree more. His compositions will transcend time and continue to be celebrated.
It took me way to long to figure out this was “without you”
Gave me chills, we can all only hope to be remembered in such a beautiful way..
Another Love?
I’m not crying you’re crying!
What song is this?
“My heart is beating I can't see clear.  How I'm wishing that you were here”
This is so beautiful!!! 💔
Amazing. Rest In Peace 
Brought tears to my eyes. I’m glad I got to see him at Coachella 2012. Unfortunately his set wasn’t that great but his music is. May he RIP and put on a set of a lifetime in heaven. 
What song is this, such a touching tribute should have a name to go with it
Wow. What an amazing tribute. 
Oh my god. I didn't have internet access yesterday. This is how I found out he passed away. RIP Tim.
Wow this is amazing RIP ♥️
Rip Avicii
Amazing. God bless. /Swede
What a nice touch
What song is it?

I'm not really familiar with edm but this was moving
Dude that totally pulled my heart strings. I'm sure Avicci would've loved this.
This is a really beautiful thing. 
Now I'm all for this guy, and I'm not trying to be mean but was he really that big of a deal around the world? I honestly just didn't know he was so big. 
This made me sad..

Respect.
Please someone wake him up, its all over :(
Just gave me chills... 
I don’t even listen to Avicii’s music and this made me tear up. Now I’m listening to his music on Spotify 


Edit: this is from the cathedral in Utrecht too! I was in the city back in January :)

Much love to the Dutchies💗💗🇳🇱
This is rlly nice but i don't know what song they're playing, i've only heard a few avicii songs ;; oops
I didn't know you can add a MIDI track to the church bells.

That bell guy was waiting for this moment all his life, he finally got to shine.
I understand why, but the bells are still sooooo dire.
Sorry but lol why do Netherlands’s play this? He was Swedish 
Did he die of drugs? My buddie was saying he died from being an addict but I said I always thought he was kind of a sickly guy. Side note, I live in Japan and he cancelled 3 concerts here and never made it.

Seconded, really touching. Thanks
God just wanna listen to electronic music.
This is so beautiful
Your welcome 
Everything about this is so sad. He was such an incredible person. :(

I didnt have sound on and was confused as to why it was a video.
De stadsbeiaardier bespeelt elke zaterdagochtend van 11 tot 12 de beiaard van de Dom. Indien er die week dan een groot artiest is overleden, speelt ze altijd een tribuut. Ook Bowie, Bennington en Jackson zijn ooit voorbij gekomen, om maar even drie voorbeelden te noemen.
Die glasbak maakt het nog net even wat vertrouwder op de een of andere manier.
[deleted]
Tears indeed: sad, but unmistakably beautiful. 
I had no idea he died until I just read this comment. 

What the fuck???????????????? 

:( :( :( :( :( :( 
> vandaag klinkt Avicii. 

Well said
Dat is heel gaaf om over na te denken!
Yes it is! Slightly unrelated, but if you want to see a bit of an interview-kinda thing with the woman who plays it, together with Swedish musician Wintergatan, [here's the video for you](https://youtu.be/6CQgzqYuo04). Idk if you've heard of the Marble Machine song, but that's what they'll play in the video :)
Yes it is real
Yes it is. OP commented some additional info.

Translation: 

> Every saturday morning, from 11 to 12 o'clock, the [carillonneur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carillon#Carillonneurs) plays a piece of music on the carillon of [the Dom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_Tower_of_Utrecht). If a famous artist passed away in the last week, she always plays a tribute. To name three examples, the same thing happened when Bowie, Bennington and Jackson died.


Yes it is real. It is called a [carillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carillon) and many belltowers in the Netherlands and Flanders are equiped with such a musical instrument.
Even crazier is that it's a life performance played by a single person.
What song is it? I can't make it out.

EDIT: I can hear it now, it's wake me up. The echo makes it sound rough. I wonder if there's a recording closer to the church...

EDIT2: I'd never heard without you before, so that completely through me.
Iirc they did this for Chester as well after he killed himself. I'll try and find a link.

Edit: found it https://youtu.be/4BYMKCuuxDY
The church bells also played a song of Linkin Park when Chester Bennington died
Bij deze! Maar naar mijn Drive geüploadet omdat ik niet weet hoe het internet werkt.

Oh die zou ik wel zo willlen horen.
Graag zelfs.
Zeker weten!

graag
Usually am not affected by these kinds of things, nor was I that big of a fan of his. But for some reason the fact that he's my age, speaks my language and seemed like a nice guy kinda makes it more sad.

Minns jag läste att han villa lugna ner sig från det hektiska DJ livet (kändes som om han referrerade till knark och supande). Synd att han inte fick sitt mera lugna liv ändå.
We tried that once, but the international community kinda frowns on colonialism nowadays.
That,s simple.
If it aint dutch, it aint much (:
We don't have enough bike lanes.

Als ik het beetje goed gelezen heb allemaal is hij ten onder gegaan aan werkdruk dat een ongezonde levensstijl met zich meebracht. Ik bedoel het is niet best als je op je 24ste al organen moet laten verwijderen.
Zo heeft ze ook [MarbleMachine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q) gespeeld ooit, omdat de maker ervan op bezoek was.
Dit hoort de top comment te zijn. Hulde aan deze dame die het carillon al bijna zeven jaar mag bespelen met een perfecte mix van historie, traditie en actualiteit. Utrecht mag trots op haar zijn.
Wow, zij is gewoon de stadsbeiaardier van Nijmegen op maandag. Nooit geweten!
That was awesome thanks :)
Vergeet [Linkin Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BYMKCuuxDY) niet.
There's a link to that song being played a couple of comments back, but the link currently doesn't work - hoping OP will fix it
Graag gedaan! Alles om mijn mooie stadsie te promoten he ;)
Sounds like one of them was 'without you'
Wake me up first and without second
First ±20 seconds is 'Wake Me Up', second song (starting at 0:30) is 'Without You'.


In Dutch, Dom can mean both stupid or cathedral. In this case it is the second. 
A "Dom" is another word for a church (latin - Domus Dei, House of God)

In the Netherlands, if we are talking about the Dom, everyone here knows we mean the Dom of Utrecht (our most well-known one)

So... "Dom doet avicii" translates to "Dom tower of Utrecht performs Avicii" :)
Dom is the name of the church tower
First ±20 seconds is 'Wake Me Up', second song (starting at 0:30) is 'Without You'.

Wake Me Up, Without You and Hey Brother
Ten years ago the artist Kyteman did a live thingy where the Dom tower  played a part. They had to account for the time delay [but frikkin' cool end result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36XJJi_2nFI).
Ik think they can disconnect the keyboard from the carillion, and hook it up to the 'automatic' play instead. There is a mechanism that can play different tunes, the one that plays the half-hourly church-bells. Then you wouldn't hear anything, but you could practice from sheet music. At least I think so. 

[This clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CQgzqYuo04) has been posted somewhere in this thread, and it's about how the mechanism works, and at they end they play a few tunes, such as Black Hole Sun, and the Marble Machine song. 
First ±20 seconds is 'Wake Me Up', second song (starting at 0:30) is 'Without You'.

Avicii, popular Swedish EDM artist. (May have left out an i or added an extra i to his name) 
Swedish DJ Avicii was found dead in his room yesterday night. He was 28 years old.
Avicii died and hes swedish. It is a tribute
(it's in the title)
That’s a huge praise coming from AVB. Arguably the best EDM performance I’ve ever seen. 
That's tom Odell?
First 20-30 seconds is “Wake Me Up”, then “Without You”.
First ±20 seconds is 'Wake Me Up', second song (starting at 0:30) is 'Without You'.

Here's a video of how the bells are played: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CQgzqYuo04
He was already famous when Levels was released. Bromance is what made him famous in the Netherlands. 
[removed]
She did the same for bowie
Bell girl.
Why not? 
[removed]
Aviicii touched me and my life.
An introvert who just wanted to make music.   
Couldn't handle the pressure. He was as old as me so it struck me harder.
Fitting that it's a Swede visiting as well. As a Swede my self, I always felt a deep respect for the Dutch and even considered moving there. This only strengthens those feelings. It's all so beautiful and respectful.
Oh man, that just makes the tribute to Avicii so much more beautiful knowing it was a real person actually playing the instrument that is those bells to do it, not just something programmed by a computer or speakers inside the tower or whatever else. Reminds me that each of us acting with love individually is what makes the world a better place. When we decide that something is important enough to us that we have to do something about it, in whatever small way is within our power, that is the moment in which the world becomes a little better place. And in this age more than ever in history you cannot know how far your actions will travel and, to borrow words from Thoreau, we may "not know by how much truth is stronger than error". One person doing their job with passion and choosing to remember & honor Bergling has reached thousands of people around the world and I think when humans try our best to immortalize each other that's a beautiful thing borne of love and respect.
That’s wonderful. 
With most instruments, you can practice at home and master your craft.  Wonder what the church-bell-player practices on?
That was epic! 
Wow

She seems to be a really cool lady with a lot of passion for it.
“Can you play Star Wars?”
This was a very cool video! 
Staat toch heerlijk op je cv

Can we talk about your username for a second, please?

At some point you hear the sound of Glas either being put in a bin for recycling or the bin being emptied. Previous commenter said that added a fun effect.
That’s one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen
Thats incredible. Thank you for the video!
Vintergatan is fucking insane.
First ±20 seconds is 'Wake Me Up', second song (starting at 0:30) is 'Without You'.
The first 20 or so seconds is Wake Me Up then the rest of the song is Without You
Hey /r/all, this link is a different video of the tower playing Hey Brother by Avicii.
Here's a reupload as the allowed amount of plays has been exceeded.

Hier is een reupload omdat het toegestane aantal afspeelsessies is overschreden.

https://youtu.be/SZwKF1hM2Xk
Here is the youtube link:
https://youtu.be/P29SPfjld3U
Het toegestane aantal afspeelsessies is overschreden, we kunnen 'm niet meer bekijken. Misschien youtube?
if i recall he struggled with depression and drug/alcohol abuse.

pretty sure he put touring on a pause a few years ago to try and sort stuff out.

he found a lot of success but struggled to find happiness. sad stuff.
Hans narko forbrug var vidst ret vildt. Deadmau5 syntes det var for meget iirc. Synd det skulle ende på den måde. Må han hvile i fred.
It's the first time I actually cried about an artist passing away. His music was always in the background somewhere when I was growing up.
I wish the Dutch didn't give up on Australia. 
NYC thanks you for the pirates, Sunday boozing, and general fun raucousness that is the foundation left by the Dutch. The lack of English Puritanism at the onset is what makes this place so great!!
I wish the dutch still "owned" belgium, grtz a flemish belgian somewhere in Zuid-Nederland
[removed]
Is dit niet wat speculatief?
Dat ik dat nog nooit eerder heb gezien! Wat een vet ding. Ben wel benieuwd hoeveel er aan het geluid gesleuteld is voor dit filmpje.
[Bewijs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a05-r0VcCZQ). Voor meer uitleg over het spelen en een kleine rondleiding van de toren is er nog [dit filmpje](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CQgzqYuo04).
Tevens een Zweed meen ik, ik heb hem in Zweden een keer zien optreden in ieder geval
En dat in de steigers!
Dutch is a language of maximum efficiency 
Ah my mistake, thank you! 
Thanks a lot man
I agree! Love AVB too. He said it in his interview on BPM Sirius last night. 
he did a remix
thank you!!
Probably one of the coolest things I've ever seen. 
Fair point. I'll just delete my silly post. Thanks for replying.
Have you ever heard of the [27 club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club)? It's very strange. There are so many songs that reference it, too. Most recently in the mainstream I think Colors by Halsey. "I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old." 
> Could not handle the pressure.

I don't know what you mean by this, but he had heart problems his whole life and has had multiple surgeries over time. I do not believe he took his own life nor did he overdose, his time was simply cut short.
Hah, alot of Dutch would move to Sweden in an instant of they'd get the chance
Małgorzata Fiebich, the woman playing the songs, is actually Polish, not Dutch. 
Heck, if for some reason I'd ever have to move to another country, the Nordic countries would be my first choice. (And hopefully I wouldn't have to move anywhere else) Especially Denmark since it seems like a pretty bicycle friendly country and I wouldn't know how to get around without my bicycle. 
Probably a pipe organ or just a keyboard 
she just has jam sessions at 3 am
"Jarenlange ervaring als beiaardier? Met dode artiestentributes? Sorry, maar we zijn hier geen beiaardenhuis..."
Wintergatan, geweldig =) 
Wow hoe heb ik dit nog nooit gezien. Wintergatan is geweldig.
krijg er een brok in mn keel van als utrechter
>Bennington
It really is! I love Wintergatan, and I love his YouTube-videos. I'm so glad he made this particular one!
Thanks.
Thanks.

Money can’t buy happiness 
He had pancreatitis at 26 which is pretty major and fucks up your pancreas for life. If you continue drinking alcohol after acute pancreatitis you can developed chronic pancreatitis which is one of the most painful ailments in the world. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy if I had a worst enemy. Most alcoholics don’t get pancreatitis until their late 50’s. You have to drink almost a handle of liquor a day for years to te pancreatitis in your 20’s
Welp he's about the same age as me so I remember going from "ehh some swedish twat whatever" to "hey this is actually pretty good" to "he's got some skills in composing this shit

Give up? Hmm maybe we shouldn't have sailed right past it and left it for england...

G'dmidag mate! 
Doubt we would've been much better. 
As an Australian, I'm glad you did. Sorry guys, but having English as my native language is just too useful. 
Of course, no other non English speaking country speaks English like the Dutch. You guys are amazing. 
We didnt have enough criminals to send there
Or New York.
Most of us would welcome the Flemisch tbh (would make us the 3rd economy in the EU funnily enough). Not the walloons though, they can go and join the French.
[removed]
Welkom op het internet...
Gedeeltelijk wel ja, we weten de doodsoorzaak pas zeker als het onderzoek afgerond is natuurlijk.
Is dat niet elke keer het geval als een artiest onder de 30 jaar overlijd? Misschien is het inderdaad voorbarig, maar wie staat er nou echt van te kijken als het wel zo blijkt te zijn?
Als je die docu op Netflix kijkt is het vrij duidelijk
tuurlijk.

Maar als 28 jarige ga je over het algemeen niet plotseling dood op een natuurlijke manier. Zal wel een flink combinatie zijn geweest van drank, drugs en teveel te lang werken.

Je kunt (of misschien kon) de marblemachine bekijken in het klokkenmuseum in Utrecht.  Ik heb hier een rondleiding gehad en de vrouw daar zei dat de video enorm gefabriceerd was. Er is nog nooit een moment geweest waarop alle onderdelen van de marblemachine tegelijkertijd werkte. De opnames voor de video hebben zolang geduurt dat man in de video ondertussen zijn haar had laten knippen met een foto erbij van hoe zijn haar eruit zag tijdens de eerste opnames zodat voor de continuïteit van de video wel klopte.
Veel, hij heeft van elk instrument wat erin zit een microfoon en daar het gekuid van af moeten pakken. Ziek dat zoiets kan, je moet er maar op komen! 
Op het moment woont hij in Frankrijk, werkende aan de 2e versie. Z'n band Wintergatan is ook best leuk om te horen, ze gebruiken vaker rare dingen als instrument. Starmachine2000 gebruikt een oude typemachine bij de intro. 
No white lighters til I fuck my 28th up
But he was 28...
I didn't mean he took his own life. I meant the pressure of limelight was too much for him and that turned him self-destructive.
That's not what they were suggesting. Avicii retired from touring because of the pressure of it all
I read he had acute pancreatitis due to heavy drinking. It’s possible that played a role in his death.
I can imagine that it's a mutually shared respect. Even though it's always the Nordics getting bundled together, I believe we also share most of our values and views with the Netherlands as well.
The Dutch gave us stroopwafels though. For which the entire world should be thankful. 
The Alot of Dutch! This means it must be mutch! Sorry guys, just had to <3
Dutch guy here. Was offered a job in Sweden. Wife and I considered it for 30 seconds.

Been living in Stockholm for a year and two months now. Not going back anytime soon. The culture, the architecture, the green space everywhere, archipelago, genuine social system built on a feeling of wanting to contribute to others, the food and the great Swedish lagom mentality. Second to none.

Winters can go fuck off though. My god those were brutal months.
Nee te koud joh!
Is er iets wat Polen hier NIET komen doen? 
mooi

You should check out his previous band Detektivbyrån. Easily one of my favourite groups of all-time.
Thanks. 
Thanks. 
Ik vind het niet heel netjes om iemands video zo zonder toestemming te kopiëren, maar wie ben ik.
It was named New Holland once. Or Nova Hollandia in Latin. 

Incidentally the Dutch also named New Zealand after the province of Zeeland.
Sorry mate, but Australian isn't the same as English ;)
I'm Swedish, and I take umbrage with that :) 

I mean, the Dutch are great at speaking English, sure, but we Swedes speak English to pretty much the same extent.
The EU passport is pretty handy though. And you'd probably learn English anyway due to the Dutch school system.
Almost everybody talks English in The Netherland. If you watch international tv shows, films, play videogames, etc... you would learn English passively with subtitles + english audio.


To be fair, the netherlands is one of the worlds best non native english speaking country so maybe you would have been fine anyway ;)
Ja Wintergatan heb ik gezien! 
in 1998, my family had that acura..
All (Bic) lighters are white if you take the coloured wrapping off :(
I always think of Nordic countries as Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland & The Netherlands. Can't help it. 
Its because the Dutch  & Swedish (and to a lesser amount Norwegian and Danish) relations are going back hundreds of years ;)
There is actually scientific support for this. Maybe the most famous comparison of cultures (invented by Hofstede) looks at five dimensions of cultural traits and finds that the Dutch belong with the Nordic group. They are more similar to the Nordics than to the neighboring Germans, for example.
And poffertjes. We can’t forget poffertjes
Oef ouwie mijn carillon

Already know all about them B) I have their CDs!
Is het ook niet, maar in de beschrijving geef ik credit aan /u/bafkonijn. Ik maak ook geen inkomsten met deze video. 
Whatcha garn on about cobba, it's the same thing, fair dinkum mate. 
Bloody hell you must be right, I had to look up what umbrage meant. 
Grammatically, definitely. But in my experience, the Dutch have an easier time getting rid of their native accent. 
[Here](https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/conversation-english-eurobarometer.jpg) is a map that shows the proficiency. I have found different versions where the Dutch and Swedish percentage are closer but the map is less nice to look at.

^^^Suck ^^^it ^^^Finland
Doubt we would get an EU passport if we were. UK is EU and we didn't get it. 
Only the ones with designs are like this. All other colored bics are that color and you can’t peel it off 
I have no problem with us Dutchies taking Iceland's spot 
I really do think the netherlands is the odd one out, we are a pretty right wing country where the rest are pretty left i think.
True. Dutch people were instrumental in the foundation of Gothenburg. We still haven't quite forgiven you for that.
>Its because the Dutch & Swedish (and to a lesser amount Norwegian and Danish) relations are going back hundreds of years

There's way more to it than just that. Polish and Danish relations are going back hundreds of years to the 10th century and you can't say the two have anything in common nowadays.
Wow, that's actually really cool. Didn't know that but always had that feeling.
Actually, right after I saw you're Australian I immediatly thought about how your nickname would sound in that good ol' Australian accent. I laughed so hard :)
Strewth!
Swede with Dutch coworkers here. I can confirm this, the Dutch sound less Dutch than my Swedish coworkers sound Swedish.
According to EF's latest English proficiency inde,  NL is slightly higher, but we basicly trade places every other year
I'm not saying that a lot of Swedes manage to rid the Swedish accent when speaking English, but I've spoken to a fair number of Dutchmen, and I can't recall any of them speaking without a Dutch accent, so I'm not sure that's the case :)

YMMV of course, though.
I'm from a former colony and we got it. It's a colonization detail I guess. The Netherlands added everyone they colonized to the Kingdom of the Netherlands (which is European, thus EU). In the UK new kingdoms were created right? 
Ah hey now noooo we love Iceland, too. Include them!
I'm from Finland and I've lived in the NL for about two years now. You guys are the closest thing to Nordics there is but you're still quintessentially Continental European. Moving here was pretty seamless culture-wise and the language is easy. Still, small things like less personal space, the slightly more formal way of speaking to strangers, and a more restricted welfare state remind me that I don't live back home anymore.
I think that definition is made pretty arbitrarily in this context. In my experience, in general lines all these countries can more or less understand each other better than others, I find anyway. 
FYI if an american reads this, right for us (tho I dont really agree but I can see why) and about as far left as it gets in american politic terms 
I don't know shit about Dutch politics, but right wing populism is definitely a thing in Scandinavia 
No it's not, sure there is a right wing party in control right now for Dutch standards, but overall Dutch politics is very centered

That said, real right wing politics has gained some ground since all this terrorist scare nonsense.
Our right wing is pretty moderate compared to many right wing parties of other Western countries though. Well, at least D66, CU, CDA and VVD are. 
I think thats just because you know the swedish english accent better, because I can instantly tell whenever its a dutch person speaking english as it sounds really stupid to me. (I hear it with myself aswell)
Happy cakeday!
Are we above Finland in that ranking as well? 

Suck it Fins, Oranje Boven!

;)
Or their accents were so good you didn't notice they were Dutch ;) Same could be said for Swedes though..
Australia formerly split from the UK in 1901. We're part of the Commonwealth however, and the Queen is our head of state.

We're not a Crown Dependency though, they get UK and therefore EU passports.

The UK cannot simply add us to the Kingdom.

However, it's incredibly easy for Australians to move to Europe, so the EU passport isn't really needed. 
All languages are easy compared to finnish 😄
By miles! Our alcoholic, slightly retarded, but beloved little brother is barely even better than the germans
