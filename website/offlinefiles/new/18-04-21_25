 when I wake up but don't want to get up so I get on my knees and burry my face into the pillow. 
Are you *sure* this isn’t Nessus
Dark Souls 2 vibes
All I see is someone bent over on their knees lol

Edit: even the cloud looks a little phallic.
Booking my flight now...
If I saw this in a movie I’d think CGI
POR QUE ASTURIAAAAAAAS ES MI PATRIA

Is Asturias a nice place for visiting?
Wow, that is mind blowing!  Thank you for posting.

so why's it called "the Gate of Knowledge"?

Looks exactly like 'Black Church Rock' here in the UK.
New awolnation album cover? 
Anyone else read it as Austria, Spain and got confused? No? Just me? Okay.
The locals say if you keep walking in and back out of it, you learn what sex is like.
incredible 
What colors does it tap for?
Are those trees on top? How big is this thing??
Seen this on Ancient Aliens.  Such a cool relic left behind from the Ancients.
looks like a rock
What does it know
So beautiful 
flickr, now that's a link I haven't seen in a long time.
Looks like an AWOLnation Cover
It took 10 seconds to load the image on my fast internet. Boycott flicker
Wow. Mesmerizing. Light, composition, location... everything is perfect. Thanks for sharing it with us.

It's a Dark Souls boss level.
Heide's Tower of Flame, is that you? I feel like Majula is right around the corner. 
How have I never heard of this?
is it me, or this looks like a stone man with ass up, face down?
Isn’t this an album cover?
All spaniards have to pass this gate on their first birthday.

It's what makes them so smart and innovative and successful compared to other europeans.
Looks like (: in the thumbnail, with the reflection on the water
~~Banana~~ Plantano needed for scale.  


Oh look, finally something else than fucking Zion park n-times in a month

Reminds me of the place where Ariel's mom died

The hero we need! Thank you!

Mind if I ask how you get the direct link for flickr images like that on mobile?
it is one of the only sites I know of that hosts very large images (12mb+). it may be out dated but it is still better than a lot of other image hosting sites, especially if you upload a lot of large images.
Rip D2 :(
Don't do that in prison though.
*Bearer of the curse*
ASTUUUUUURIIAAAAAAAS,  PATRIAAA QUERIIIDAAAAAAAAAAA
It looks exactly like the spot where the dude got greyscaled
Around 300km from Dragon rock fortress ;)
Yes!! If you like mountains, the sea and food, it's a good choice!
I thought it was at first glance!
>cyka

сука is not the same thing as "cyka". Write "suka" instead next time :)
What do you mean? This is a long exposure shot
Uh, what? He didn't photoshop the water.
says more about you than it does about the picture
Very similar, but the one in the photo is in Asturias. Google both and compare.
Not OP, but this was done by viewing page source and finding the [direct image link](https://i.imgur.com/IgX0C3K.png) in the HTML. Might need to be on desktop to do that.
I don't know how to do it on mobile, or even if it's possible. 

But on desktop: press CTRL+U, then copy the image name (in this case 27729253288), press CTRL+F and paste that name, and find [this series of links/numbers](https://i.imgur.com/xGrHt1F.png). All of the image sizes are linked there. 

I love flickr because it can host huge images. For example...

https://c1.staticflickr.com//1//785//26534229217_e7423640cc_o.jpg

I would not recommend opening those images if you are on mobile however :P
I used to go on there a ton for high resolution panorama for desktops, etc.
A couple of days ago it was bought by Smugmug, which might indicate some new plans with it. 
They have a big summit this weekend with lots of big members giving input to improve the game, let’s hope it pays off
He heh. 
You are probably right

Rorschached. 
Your Google-Fu is weak:

Or any on google images:

There are lot of photos. What I don't know is what's that gate of knowledge (puerta del conocimiento? ni idea).
It is asturias. Amazing how similar they look, but they are different https://guiadeasturias.com/lugar/playa-vallina-del-gallo-pintoresca-peculiar-donde-las-haya/
They are nearly identical?! I will hopefully make it to see this one in Spain one day!
