My wife made this cheese board in about 30 mins. What do you guys think?

There's barely any cheese

Edit: It looks great tho
Looks amazing for nibbles, not sure I'd be calling it a cheese board but it does look fantastic.
Too many nuts but a beautifully display 
Yeah how about some more cheese and calm it down with all the nuts.
My diverticulitis say no but my stomach says yes 
like others have said, needs more cheese

but it has inspired me to make a cheese tray of my own and devour it by myself
Needs toothpicks. Ain't no one going for olives if they have to scrapefor it with a cracker.
I think it looks great, but I wouldn't share that with anyone because of the pistachios and the amount of saliva on folks' fingers.

And I'm unsure how it qualifies as a *cheese* board, but it does look nice.
Looks nice but in my opinion you need fresh bread, better than crackers!
Doesn't resemble any cheeseboard I've ever seen in my life... not a fan if I'm honest.
This is the sort of thing I'd see in a shop display and the food is fake because of how badly I want to eat it
I would eat iy without hesitation, but I feel like it might be a bit too busy or too crowded, especially if there is a large group.  Lots of chance to touch nearby bits while you go for your bite.
I think the problem with presentations like these is that they get very unappetizing as soon as they start getting eaten. Kill about half the ingredients and you've got something.
Showed this to my girlfriend and she has it now as her phone background. 

Amazing 
I think I could fill that WAY faster than 30 minutes /s

But seriously, looks good. Needs cheese.
Not a cheese board or plate, but a nibbles tray. I‚Äôm part of the crowd that says it was 10 mins worth of work max due to the lack of real arrangement. That and it being mostly nuts and olives, things that can just be dumped into a dish. 
dawg, all she did was lay down a little meat and cheese.
Where can I find a wife like yours?? 
A+
Looking delicious! But can you just .... **rotate the goddamn picture** damn it...
What do I think? You married the right womanüòÇüëå
I think you should give me her number... so she can make this for me!
Yum! I‚Äôm totally gonna make this for myself now! Love how she used fresh fruits, pistachios, and dates. Thx for sharing!
Love it.  Looks really pretty.  Also, I am inspired by the idea of putting a sweet jam (perhaps she used apricot jam?) and sprinkles on top of a wedge of cheese.  Pretty and practical.  

Thanks for sharing.
Is that a slice of pizza in the middle?
Meh.
Work of art!
Meh, what's with all the fruit and shit?
What took so long?
Nice, but kinda crowded
Looks good, but not enough cheese
I recognize the rind on that Manchego .. possibly from Publix? I love that stuff.. it's as good or better than a good aged provolone.
If I had to guess, I'd say you enjoy Trader Joe's as much as I do. Those sesame covered cashews are crack.
Yum!
Does anybody every eat this stuff or just look at it? 

Omomnomnomnom
This looks cool because it's a* box filled to the brim with assorted edibles. At the end of the day though, your strawberries have meats coming out from behind them...
I think she spent a lot of time and money shopping ahead of time. Do you have a price figure? Also, I'd really love to be sitting around that table.
Alright. You know what? You just made me hungry!!!
There is nothing I love more than trying to beautifully present food, and this is so gawjussss! I love the way the cheese is arranged slanted up like that!! 
someone please get me a glass of wine to go with those cheese
It‚Äôs beautiful.
You should divorce her and remarry her. That sort of culinary expertise deserves double wifing 
I like the look, has a very natural , kind of forest floor type look
And suddenly everyone becomes a cheeseboard critic
Charcuterie boards get me fucking moist 
Keep her. That looks great, and don‚Äôt listen to the haters: there are clearly four kinds of cheese in there (would be a ton on any normal board), and the nuts will all be appreciated! Go her!
You married the right woman.....
This would be the holy grail for 420
That everything is touching and ruining the taste of other things.
... I‚Äôve seen better 
I think these cheeseboards that you guys always seem to love here are ostentatious as fuck.
Why are these always so disorganized?
I think i want to marry your wife. 
nice, but it looks like mostly grapes and pistachios. 
Looks delicious. Especially all the pistachio and green olives
Great job!! Very creative.
Is she single?
Too busy. Shouldn‚Äôt have let her dump all those damn nuts and fruit all over. 
Took 30 minutes to put stuff on a tray 
I think you need to hold the phone sideways when you take a picture : )
Tell your wife I'm going to marry her. 
Edible Picasso
Marry her.
Dibs not tidying up
Divorce her and give her to me
‚ÄúWash your hands Mark!‚Äù
This says nothing about the quality of your food service, but my wife is allergic to nuts, so I thought I would share just how hilariously dangerous this looks. Just a bunch of delicious meat and cheese nestled into a bed of pistachios haha

I, however, would be stoked on this!
I think you are a lucky man.
Holy moly guacamole  extra cheesy pepperoni
That's amazing!
Like how your wife vertically wegded the manchego. Also the nut coverage is lovely..great colors!
Yummy.  Looks awesome.  
She has a talent
Looks pretty legit!
Yeah pretty impressive. Not sure if I could open that many packages in 30 min.
I'm hungry now:)
looks like it took 20 mins
has a very bourgie kind of look to it
30 min to do this ? Lol
Not sure, we will need to see a pic of her.
My ex gf once sent me to the kitchen to make some "nibbles", I come back holding a chopping board with an unopened block of cathedral city and a bag of prawn crackers plonked on top. 

She wasn't impressed.
how many ppl this for?
Op stole pic
Yeah but where is the SPAM?
Did she get most of her ingredients from Trader Joe's?
Fkin A man... Quick., put a ring on it!!

...

...

Wait. Oh. 
I think, ‚Äúwhat is a cheese board?‚Äù
What wine did you serve with it?  Looks excellent by the way...
Your wife is great, Looks so good.

The food.
That‚Äôs a rich persons amount of pistachios.
Wife her twice! 
*fruit and nut board
A little cheesy
I'm upset that I can't eat a picture.
Wife her up bro.
Congrats, that made my mouth water (which pics of food rarely do).

IDGAF if it's not a "cheese board" to some peoples' definition. I mean, that's not a "pizza" slice either, but it looks (and taste~~s~~d fantastic).

That tray would be *gone* in less than 10 minutes, and would be a frequent request.

Love the layout and composition.  Food porn, indeed!  Something like that would sell for $50 to $70 around here, and not be put together nearly so well.

Kudos to your wife!
I think u should propose to her
That cheese board is visually stunning, and I like how health forward it is with the fruit and nuts included. People forget that a serving of cheese is like two thumbs or an ounce. 
Can't really see it under all that stuff.
Looks Gouda to me!
What do I think? I think I'm going to marry your wife
I think that, you, should marry your wife!
It looks like a deathtrap!
but I'm allergic to pistachios though
we call those "tasty plates" in my house, when you just throw a bunch of tasty shit on a plate.
Looks good
Work of art
Wife her again.
Damn that looks so good.mouth watering atm.
I love the pistachio as filler. It looks amazing!
Got any cheeeeze
Wheres the meat, and the cheese?
No way. She put all of that stuff on a plate in 30 minutes? She must move like the flash!
When I get my life together financially I really want to do this 
That's a nut platter but I love it! Looks so delicious!!
The fact that she completely separated the olives makes her my hero. Fuck olives.
I mean how many people is such a board supposed to feed? Noob here
I think it's a fruit and nut tray with a couple of pieces of cheese. But it looks pretty fancy. 
That's nuts. 
The alternating manchego slices are great! 
Pm the address. See you soon.
Does your table have "lion paws" at its base?
Your wife must did something wrong to you! Sorry man.
Can I be married to your wife too?
Looks like a dinner straight outta a greek myth
It looks good, but when you break it down, it's basically just a big pile of food in a box.
You better put a ring on it.
Decent , needs more cheese
Looks really good!  I'd eat it.  All of it. Probably including the board it's served on.  
29 minutes would have been nice, but I guess 30 minutes is acceptable 
Aesthetics - gorgeous.  Functionality - polarizing, see previous posts.  I personally would avoid this type of tray because I don‚Äôt trust humans to wash their hands well enough.  30 minutes prep is impressive.  
Is she single?
Im a simple man. I see pistachios, I upvote.
"About 30 minutes" being 59 minutes?
I'm impressed she made cheese that fast
Looks like a mess, actually. 
I would like a fedora, a whip, and a shovel to excavate around the nuts.  This just looks like a lot of fun and delicious to boot.
S T A C K E D
Is your wife single by any chance? 
Can she be my wife too?
Caramelized onion cheddar and sesame nuts from Trader Joes. Your wife has good taste in cheese. I'll bet that Manchego is Trader Joes as well.
Perfect with beer
It looks gorgeous. Your wife is a genius. 
meat mixed with berries.. yum
Put a ring on her. Actually divorce her just so you can marry her again.
More cheese.
That looks amazing! ü§§
I think your mother can accomplish more in 30 minutes than I could in a week. 
I think you're a lucky man
The real question is what took you so long to put a ring on it
H√© crackers and garniture
That's cheesy.
She must work at a zoo feeding animals thought deserts when they have been good.
Saved this photo to use as...something later? Inspiration? Idk
Thought I was on r/woodworking for a moment cause of the way it's titled. 
I think we need an address to partake in this platter! 
Needs more cheese.
*my wife 
I cannot think of a whiter activity to do. This looks some fake cheese board at Pier 1 

Looks nice though
Where‚Äôs the butter?
Olives are gross and the pistashceohs aren't even peeled.  This is poor service.
That's what I imagine rich people's lunchables look like.
I hate it

I‚Äôm hungry now...
That's beautiful, but it needs more cheese!! 
I wouldn't put meat behind the strawberries but other than that it looks great!!
Marry her. 
30 minute work? Heck that looks like a 2 hour effort honestly. She whipped up one hell of a dish I tell ya.
Mods can we get a "cheese board" filter so I never have to look at shit like this again? 
Not good.
My wife made me zoom in and scroll around to admire everything... Tell your wife that the wife of random internet stranger says kudos. 
It's a work of art. It actually looks so fucking good. I definitely need to go my cheeseboard game. 
I think it looks great, but the picture really needs to be flipped around.
Looks like a 30mins cheese board 
Come in Europe and get some real stinky cheese!
Is your wife Martha Stewart?
I think she got a little lazy with the strawberries, who doesn't cut the stems off! Gosh
Honestly, it's super attractive, but there are always left overs or something that people dont choose as often. This would be a pain in the ass to separate after a party to bag as leftovers...
I can't believe how much hate I'm seeing. This looks great, and very well-crafted. Well done, OP's wife
Where's the fucking cheese?
RIP Guests with nutt allergies.
Few too many nuts for me, and what‚Äôs that white stuff ‚Äúsmegma‚Äù üò±.
Wow, didn't realize people could be such stuck up snobs when it came to cheese boards. This looks really cool, OP.
Needs more cheese, but I would still destroy this. Nice work!
Your wife is a magician!
K
Looks good but there‚Äôs not enough cheese
Beautiful but more meats! And cheeeese
More meat and cheese
Nice selection, practically though; it's hard to cut the cheese with all the other shit in the way.

Not enough cheese, way too much random stuff, how do you cut the cheese ? Look pretty though
What did she do with the 29 minutes she had left after dumping all that shit in the tray?
I think your cheese to pistachio ratio is fucked.
After looking at the cracker to meat and cheese ratio, it‚Äôs gonna be a no for me dawg 
SO GOOD.
This looks great!! I‚Äôd be snacking away in no time. 
Uhuh... cool.... we have cheese... grapes... pistachios... a slice of pizza... biscuits... 
Nice! Is she seeing anyone?
Marry her again.
Does your wife wanna decorate my house she‚Äôs seems very good as arranging things 
Good lord that is some bountiful shit
I think **SEND IT TO ME**.
I've seen better..but not many.
Imagine after getting into a bit of that cheese and it spreads onto the nuts and then you end up with gooey clusters of nuts. Apart from that yum. And like everyone else, more cheese
GIMME!!!
Just a preference thing I guess, and it does look great, but the ratio of cheese to nuts and grapes and other stuff is just tooooo low. 

I do especially like the arrangement or the sliced cheese that looks like one of those industrial anything shredders, that‚Äôs a win 

Edit: industrial anything shredder: 
https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.geek.com/geek-cetera/industrial-shredder-vs-vending-machine-predictable-but-satisfying-results-1544201/%3Famp%3D1?source=images
Very visually appealing but I'm fat and want more cheese
I think it took longer than thirty minutes!  But it‚Äôll take me less time to eat it. So it evens out. 
Hey it's me your daughter. I'll be downstairs in a sec kthnx
Is this what kings would eat?
30 minutes?  Marry this woman. 

Oh. Right. 
Would have been better if she prepared it in 25 minutes
Not enough meat. Not enough cheese. Too much fruit. Way too much on the nuts. And the bucket of mustard is MIA. 
Makes me want to know your political affiliation 
I think you are one lucky dude. üòäüëçüèªüôåüèª.   She‚Äôs a keeper!!
Bit of a cheese bucket?
It's aight
Keeper.
It's a cheese board who ducking cares
Fill the inner areas of grapes and pistachios with more cheese and it‚Äôd be perfect. But it still looks delicious as is. 
How long did it take her to put all the food on, once she made the board?
Masterpiece. If my wife made this we'd have a fight because I'd eat it all and wouldn't let her go near it.
How do you make cheese in 30 minutes
It looks very nice and now everyone has the flu.
Looks yummy.. but way too busy. 
I think there shouldn‚Äôt be things called cheese boards 
That i dont like cheese
I think She's Bored
Marry that woman 
I don‚Äôt see any sandwiches on there. Tell her to try again 
Why is there so little cheese lmao
I think your wife just cleaned out the refrigerator. 
1/10
When the hell would these be appropriate? I see them all the time here on reddit. Surely you don't eat all of it. What do you do with the rest?
30 min? come on! looks good tho...
I'd be afraid to eat anything because I might accidentally touch something I wasn't reaching for.
Looks like a bird threw up
Unnecessary, blueberries mixed with hard shell pistachio. You're wasting food and spent way to long. Spread a bunch of cheese out like playing cards on a poker table and call it a day. 
Anyone can make a mediocre cheeseboard in 30 minutes if you‚Äôre wealthy enough 
Marry her
Haters gonna hate, but I'm really into this. So composed, so bountiful. Thanks for sharing!
Marry her

But seriously it looks amazing.
Can she be my wife too?
Think you should marry her
Apart from the fact that there is about 1/6th of cheese on the cheese platter my honest advice is to have more bread and less crackers. Decent bread, not bright white bread. Not all cheeses go well with crackers. 
looks delicious, but what has she done the other 20min?
Too crowded, not enough meat.
I don't think the point of a cheese board is having to dig through everything to get to the item you'd like to eat. 
Looks good and professional
looks like you haven't put together your fruit and nut bar yet....not seeing any cheese or boards here......
Don't listen to them. I wouldn't touch the cheese, but I'd eat pretty much everything else on the tray! Looks great!
where is repost?
I eatsa the pizza?
It's also not on a board. I'm going with Snack Tray, and it looks delicious.
MORE CHEESE! MORE CHEESE! MORE CHEESE! MORE CHEESE!
THAT‚ÄôS A LOT OF NUTS
Yep. This looks very good but there is nothing more annoying than ordering a cheese board at a restaurant and it being mostly crackers and nuts. 
r/wewantcheese
Yeah, was kinda searching for all the cheeeeezzzzzeeeeee :P 
My exact thought. Fucking internet is stealing all my original thoughts
First thing I noticed too. Needs more cheese less nuts. 
Looks better then a cheese board honestly
This is a "I throw anything I found in my kitchen and my refrigerator" plate not a cheese plate, I agree, still look delicious.
Why are people so shitty and negative on here?  
Geez 

That looks Terrific!! 
It's a box of happiness
Nibbles? She needs to be really damn hungry from what I can tell
Hence why it was the wife and not the OP who made it :P 
Also, 30 mins? 5. Maybe 10, tops.   


Would eat though. 
That's the thing. It looks great as a whole, but if I look at the individual food items, it doesn't look all that appetising. 20000 pistachios? A metric tonne of grapes? No thanks 
Same as your mum. 
‚ÄúCalm It Down With All the Nuts,‚Äù name of your sex tape 
Maybe OPs wife likes nuts?
There‚Äôs a pretty decent amount of cheese (4 different types). It just seems like there isn‚Äôt much because there‚Äôs so much else. Way too busy. 
the research about people with diverticulitis needing to avoid seeds and nuts has been debunked, so snack away! :)
Diverticulitis is a pain in the ass. 
We all consume foodporn but it doesn't make us any better at the act right?

GO FOR IT pm me when you post I want to see it.
I dunno I think this is kinda a given that it‚Äôs ‚Äúall hands accepted‚Äù given you would have to grab everything else
As a german I second this!
Just look like an artful display of a bunch of random excess stuff from the fridge and pantry 
Why does everyone ITT assume that this is for more than one person?
Remove kitchen cupboard drawer. Empty cabinets into drawer. 

Open fridge. Dump contents in. Done. 
Way way more cheese. This is more of a fruit and nut tray than a cheese tray. 
How are you not seeing any real arrangement? They took the time to flip flop the cheese slice and alternate crackers.
They really did take time to make a nice presentation. 
Right? Someone who loves pistachios as much as I do. 
Just open it on mobile and then turn your phone 90¬∞ at a time. You're welcome.
Brie is fantastic paired with jams! Especially apricot!
I think it‚Äôs a wedge of Brie. Drizzled with honey and sprinkled with nuts. Cheeeessseeeee
I think its a slice of wedding cake that got hit by a few nuts and raisins.
I think that's cheesecake 
I thought the same thing
Brumotactillophobia.
I was just thinking the same thing, I don't understand why everyone loves it. In my opinion, there is just far too much happening here, especially with the fucking nuts and shit. 
Because they are trying to be artsy 


Because people don't understand what items compliment each other in taste. This seems like his wife just emptied their pantry onto a tray.
It looks like a house burglar who decided to take one of their kitchen drawers filled with food as a little snack.  
My two favorite things
How would this take you two hours, you just pour the nuts and fruit on the tray. And as others have said, there is barely any meat and cheese. 

I was going to ask what she did for then other 20 minutes
> nutt 

Dude nooo. It looks like mozarella. Y u do dis
idk why you're getting downvoted...
Um...
It's a monkey platter! 

Edit: LPT for parents. This counts as a healthy dinner, and kids can prepare it themselves.
I think that‚Äôs the drawer from one of their kitchen cabinets.  
It‚Äôs a cheese trough 
THAT‚ÄôLL BE FOUR BUCKS BABY!
The tray or his wife?
LOL
I‚Äôd pay you to open every container, slice the strawberry‚Äôs, pull the grapes off, and arrange all this in 10 minutes. Prove to me you can in 10 minutes. There are what? 18-19 items there? 30 seconds per item to get it out of where it‚Äôs stored, open and arrange it? Yeah ooookay.
That‚Äôs what I thought too, no doubt it looks good,  but 30 minutes?! 
Maybe she has arthritis or was really baked. 
Downvotes for that? Seriously, I‚Äôm with you. What took so long?
pistachios are delicious 
Also only one type of cracker and two types of meat. I demand more from my charcuterie. 
Bitch much?
Jake Peralta!
Nine Nine!!
Peralta you're a genius!
Well this isn't about what OP's wife likes, this is about what we, the consumers, like, and we say too many damn nuts.
Serious?
Isn't it pain in the bowels?
As a French I can agree even better!
I think it's the quantity of food!
üòÇ
Agreed (and not a negative towards OP)
5 comments here and only one of them recognizes brie. good lord what an uncultured herd of swines reddit can be
can i eat it like a slice of Pizza?
sounds like a shit brie if you have to cover it up so you don't taste how shit it is
> Brumotactillophobia

Not guilty on this, here in the picture the taste are so different and strong/not strong that some will ruin the other. Like the disgusting people putting olive/pineapple on pizza and ruining the whole pizza.
Would be great for you then, but still not really a cheese board, as many have said. 
I'm that kind lf person when it comes to cooking :P
my phone autocorrects nut to but so I spelled it nutt which autocorrects to butt.  I'm fucking confused man.
Could be mozzarella cheese, but could be smegma cheese also.
I suppose the proofs in the tasting, you go first üëç.
Yah it's weird
It's a slab of lies 
I‚Äôd love a cheese draw
YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT?
Are you also saying 30 minutes is too long? I looked at that shit and though 'no fuckin way that took only 30 minutes'. 
I mean, if you're figuring out what to put in it, pulling it all out, and actually arranging stuff rather than randomly throwing it in a box, yeah.
Arranging things and slicing things. A majority of that time is spent on presentation, its arranged very nicely.
18 items all needed pulled from the cabinets or fridge. Strawberries sliced, grapes pulled apart, meat rolled up, everything arranged and then put away. You replied to someone saying 5-10 minutes. That‚Äôs like 30 seconds an item. I‚Äôd love to see you do it faster. 
Yeah you‚Äôve never made anything your life have you?
if i start eating them i cant stop until they're finished no matter what
So are grapes
Also worth their weight in gold, apparently.  The pistachio shelf at my store is easily worth a few grand.
am serious! look it up, it's no longer promoted as 100% sound medical advice :)
I love Baguette <3
Exactly!
I think most of us recognized it but chose to pretend it was something else.
First time making a recipe always takes longer than expected.
I laughed, don't know why you got downvoted though. You're back up to 1, have a great day :)
butt nutt
I called it a nut board üòè
Heinous fuckery most foul!
it can go next to the pancake drawer
I could definitely do it quicker. What she did is really easy. 5 minutes is definitely cutting it short, but 15 would be no problem. And that's including getting everything put away. Then again, I do work at a speedy restaurant, so working quickly with food is quite easy for me.

Edit: To clarify I am not trying to discount this nice work! It looks great and I would enjoy eating it very much! I just wanted to throw my ideas on the speed factor in there.
Nope, I‚Äôve never spilled my nuts or cut the cheese..
everything in moderation, even moderation 
That must be at least 5, maybe even 600 grams.
Do they know what causes it? 
:)
Please love K√∂rnerbrot ;)

This is Reddit.  Wrongness will be swiftly punished.  You have a good one as well.
That's the same name I use for /r/gonewild
Why are there pancakes in the silverware drawer... 
one of my life mottos.
not really, unfortunately. ive tried to do a fair amount of research on it (since I have it too) but there doesn't seem to be any real consensus. some people tend to be more likely to get it than others, but they can't really seem to explain why. 

there also isn't a lot of solid info on how to manage it, other than some recommendations on fiber intake. 

I left the hospital feeling like nobody could really tell me what caused it, whether it will be an ongoing condition I'll have to manage as I get older, or how to prevent it from becoming a problem again, even after they gave me packets of medical information intended for physicians. and every time I've told my doctor about symptoms since the initial incident, she just tells me to track my diet & symptoms, eat more or less fiber, or go to urgent care if I start to have severe pain and/or a fever again. kinda sucks. 
Guys, r/CreepyEmily is at it again! 
My mom was finally diagnosed with it about  a year of symptoms and only after she ended up in the er with an infection in intestine or something. She was in so much pain that even though the doctors told her she could have a normal diet and to just eat high fiber foods. She has completely changed her diet around to cut out red meat completely and anything with seeds.  you would be surprised how many foods have seeds in them. It has been a really difficult transition for her. Her doctors told her it‚Äôs not necessary but she had a flare up last year after eating at a taqueria and shes just not willing to take any chances anymore. This condition really fucking sucks.
