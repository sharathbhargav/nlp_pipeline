How cute, you can tell they are friends, kitty doesn't have claws out.  But who wants a face full of dogbreath?  
/r/creepyasterisks
that tactical stealth role in the end!
What is that title
This gif needs to be reversed. Ninja cat! Appears from nowhere!
It’s almost as if the cat knew it was being a dick and didn’t know how to apologize, so it just awkwardly tried to disappear. 
That Cat has to be related to Dale Gribble because that was a very Dale moment right there. All that was missing was pocket sand
What the heck, I have two berners and a tux kitty. BUT THAT'S NOT MY HOUSE!

Someone make this title into r/AnimalTextGifs
So many of these gifs wouldn't be nearly as hilarious if it weren't for the amazing commentary!
