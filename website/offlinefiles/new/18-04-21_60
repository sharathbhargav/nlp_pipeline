[SUGGESTION] Ability to make presets and then pick a random one if you want

That‚Äôs what we need, I would switch way more through my skins if I could do it faster! Have my upvote mate!
Also a ‚Äúrandom‚Äù option would be cool
I like your idea, have my upvote!
I just thought about this Idea Yesterday because I always switch between 2 skins (Cuddle Team Leader and Funk Ops) and I always forget to change something like the pickaxe or freefall trail. Presets would definitly amazing. Take my upvote.
We don't want this... We need this!
Please. I think it would be awesome if u could do a random combo of cosmetics each game, I find myself always using the raven, its sick but it would be cool to get a random skin every game, would be refreshing 
I honestly don't know why this hasn't been added yet? I'm no developer but I know this coding wouldn't be hard.
Reupload: thanks to gypsyleeboy for telling me to watermark <3
A preset that stores what you wear / dances maybe gliders, ...
mother of god, how much money did you spend on this game
Does it really take people that long to choose their skin setup that we need presets? Just asking. 
In my opinion, presets would only be needed if we could choose different part from different skins. Cause right now it doesn't take too much time choosing certain skins, backing etx
It was leaked a few weeks back that a random skin generator is coming at one point 
Or just let us randomise everything
Oh my god I was in the process of also making this! Have my upvote!
Let us rename the presets too!
I back this 110%!
I enjoy that the random chooses from your presets rather than just choosing at random. I would hate to get certain skins I have. 
Everyone Upvote this
I really like this idea. Especially if they allow you to swap heads from other outfits! 
Good idea, will be way more useful in the future if they add more customisation options though, right now it's easy enough to remember your favourite combos of skins back blings and pickaxes. The randomisation thing needs to be a thing for all cosmetics though
I'd love this because I have a Sgt. Green Clover set that I use often.
YES! I can never decide, Elite Agent, Dark Voyager, Mission Specialist, or default. (I have reaper but don't use him because I'm not a dweeb).
Suggestion. Mini game in the lobby for all the people who die right away in squads and then complain when they always have to wait. 
Also random every match preset? That would be cool

So call of duty, you want call of duty? 
This is the most practical suggestion I‚Äôve seen. Love it. 
i like the preset idea like classes in COD, but choosing a random one is kind of dumb.
I think this would encourage people to buy v-bucks to buy more stuff, so it's a win for Epic too
I feel like this can work like a custom classes from call of duty, before you ready up in the lobby you pick your preset or random which is located above where you change the game mode then click ready and load into the game 
It would be nice if people would take the time to send this all the way to the tippy top.
We need a random option for our loading screens. Those things get boring after seeing them a few times.
I just want an always random option so every time Ijump off the b bus Ihave no idea what im gonna be in
Great idea!
First idea I‚Äôve liked on this sub 
Yesssssssss
This is one of the suggestions that's actually in Epic's favor to implement. Making it easier to cycle through skins incentivizes having more of them, thus buying them. This has a good shot of getting in, I'd say.
Good idea. Anyone else just keep the same skin on all the time just because they cba to go through changing everything 
This has to happen, upvoted :)
Lol I just close my eyes and throw around the mouse until it hits one 
This is a good idea! With the abilty to rename them it would be amazing!
Would be cool to select a random preset from NoSkin and black backpack or NoSkin and rust bucket
no thanks
Let me tag some epic employees /u/MrPopoTFS , /u/EpicDustyDevo , 
Have my babies and my upvote üí™üèø
When you watermark your post to make sure no one steals it. 
Oh i thought you said presents... üòâ
I mean, Fornite isn't all about skin.. the game menu and all is pretty clean right now, if we put this, it would mess up isn't it ?
But it's a nice idea too
This is sooo needed 
Sugesstion: Stop being a furry.
Solid Idea!
This is what I‚Äôve wanted for so long. Thank you for creating and posting!
All of a sudden i remembered Rocket League 
Great idea my dude
too extra man it takes like 2 seconds to change ur skin 
I guarantee this will be added in the future, since it further promotes buying micro transactions. 
Why?
Warframe has this and it's so damn usefull
There should also be a random one that randomizes all of your skins, backpacks, etc...
It is a great ideea
I feel like it would be kinda useless for now but when there‚Äôs more items in the game I could definitely see this being a feature 
This is an awesome idea! reminds me of tf2, got my upvote.
100% yes
:(
It's a cool idea, Epic should push customisation more.
This is a sweet idea. \+1
Basically tf2 loadouts
!redditsilver 
All of my presets are rust lord
We fucking need this üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
upvote
I REALLY like this idea. Please epic, add this QOL update
Also called loadouts.
like i have enough skins for this
Great idea.
What also would be food is a random option
i made a post about this months ago and everyone hated on me 
/u/epicloomin hi xD
Thank you man!
Have my upvote mate mate
You mean to make a random preset or choose from a random from the list?
A random option is already coming but for whatever reason hasn‚Äôt been implemented yet
Upvotes for this and OPs idea!
I like your upvote have my idea!
Thank you!
I like your upvote, have an idea!
Ye same, i switch between the reaper, funk ops and cuddle team leader, thanks for your upvote! :D
Haha, that's the spirit!
Ye!
Ye, i program myself and it would be pretty easy
Epic probably has plans to implement this, it just probably took a backseat in development to things like gameplay changes, balance updates, new features and guns, etc.. It is a really good idea though and I hope they implement it soon.
Because it costs money in storage. Like alot
That‚Äôs what I was thinking. It‚Äôs really not that complicated. Idk how this got so many upvotes
I switch skins often between 4 presets ‚Äî my no skin, john wick, funk ops, and highland warrior. it takes me about 2-3 minutes to switch between them. it‚Äôs just be nice to be able to just hit a button 
My idea was a preset for everything, dances, back blings, gliders, skins, trails, loading screen or something like that you know
Really? I didn't know
Ye, sounds great!
Haha thanks
Thank you!
Ye
Thank you!
Thank you
What?
Thanks
:)
Ye
Thank you
I've never played tf2, do they use presets / loadouts aswell?

Ikr :D
Thank you!
Thank you
Ye true
xD
Thx
Wut
And you have my sword
I think he means a preset that randomizes everything in the slots
Haha
I like taking ideas with consent!
Alright, lay it on me
I don't think there's problem coding it, but there could be one with the database. They need to check how much data the profile takes and mutiply it by the amount of presets.
 
Simply adding 1KB of data per players, can potentially take up to 42GB on their storage.
Without seeing their source code though, it could be a simple fix or days of work...
Hey, TripleCast, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Couldn't you just store that information client side like, profile settings? 
I'm as lazy as they come and I dont even need this. 
Is your name a rookie of the year reference BTW? 
Oh I thought only for the characters, then yeah, a preset option would be good then
[Here you go ](https://fortniteintel.com/2018/04/11/random-outfit-option-coming-soon/) 
:D

I just have the blue squire skin, that‚Äôs the only reason I made this ‚Äú :( ‚Äú
Thx :)
Yes, for each class there are 4  presets which you can modify. The only differrence is that there is no random option, but that's because you get to choose weapons as well, which can actually affect the gameplay. 
Thank you mate!
... and you have my bow ... 
That sounds cool
But a random option for already existing presets would be neat too
This is what I thought OP meant with that slot to begin with. It is a fantastic idea nonetheless.
I like my idea, have your upvote!
haha yes
Store it locally?
The randomizing between presets was my main goal, it's nice to play with a different character every game :S
Last names Gardenhire so my high school coaches actually referred to me as HosenBagger from that movie. 
Ye, i didn't quite address that but i'm not gonna reupload again. Thanks for telling me tho, now i'm gonna but it in my first comment so people see.
Ye i see, but i think they should add presets aswell so you can change really quickly when you click ready.
Ah okay xD
and my axe!
Yep, there's a lot of stuff I wouldn't want to wear, but if I could rotate through presets I'd love it.
You like my Upvote, you have your idea!
Local storage allows data manipulation and corruption.  
Also, if you log from another computer, phone or console, the information won't be shared.
Just close your eyes and randomly choose each thing? I'm just busting balls. 
I thought so. I'm a 90s kid so I loved that movie. You have the same name as the former twins manager also. 
I think I‚Äôve got a pocket knife?
I take your idea, you get an upvote üëçüèª
