I think Michael would be really mad if he knew Toby beat him at something

IIRC Dwight was in every episode.
Toby is in HR, which technically means he works for corporate, so he's really not a part of our family. Also, he's divorced, so he's really not a part of his family.
Toby has bet him already — at least at “Casino Night”. 
Why is Erin only 37 episodes behind Michael? She came 4 seasons later.
**NO! NO! NO! GOD NO!**
If I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
That gazing look in Michaels eyes.... he must be looking at Ryan 
This doesn't seem accurate to me...Michael left in episode 148. I can't believe there are 9 episodes in that span that he wasn't in??
i love how Steve and Craig and Ellie all look like Hollywood versions of their characters (duh) in real life on IMDB but Paul is just a Toby picture
I don't think the numbers work out...
Who let Kevin calculate these numbers?

Edit: damn, didn’t know someone else beat me to posting this 
Of course Toby would put himself into as much episodes as he can. It's the perfect alibi.
I think I’ve matured since I moved to Colorado
139 episodes is like watching die hard 80,000 times
Can we just like get a reunion episode, where this is the plot? Micheal Just berates the film crew until they tell him why they filmed Toby so much more than him lol
Isn't Erin's name Kelly though? She started going by Erin after Charles hired her.
Oh my god. I just realized my "Internet comments/title voice" is as Michael Scott.
At first I was surprised it was only a difference of 3 episodes, then I saw Erin had well over half of Michael's episodes and I'm just really confused at how that could happen.
But it’s beach day
NO!! OH GOD NOO! NO NO NO!!!
Dwight tops them all. Thus the rest really are his subordinates
ITT: People who can't be bothered to look up The Office on IMDB themselves. 
It never "feels like" Erin was in that many episodes to me...

Maybe because I rewatch seasons 1,2,3,4 all the time...and not so much the others.
This is on their permanent records in New York.
I don't feel like this is accurate. Erin was in more episode than Jim or Pam? Or Dwight who I'm pretty sure was in all of them?
Who let the lemon head in here? You are a waste of life and you should give up. 
I bet you if we keep making this joke, they will release 4 more episodes without Toby just to update the IMDB.
Why is Toby the way he is?
You can't really compete if you quit the race early.
For the longest time I thought Darrel’s last name was fieldman 
I've only seem two episodes so far but why did Micheal leave?
Welp, time to make 4 1-hour specials so that Michael can be at 143.
He didn't beat him by much considering he was on the show from the first season to the last.
Looks like Meredith was in every episode except 1. Which one was she not in?
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Perfectenschlag
Ellie Kemperer is so damn hot. 
That and highest kill count . 
Nooooooooooo. God nooo. 
142 episodes that were partially like watching paint dry. Dammit Toby. 
I wish I could be Toby’s friend. 
Hm Erin was actually in alot 
Binged watched it all about 3 weeks ago, really should have ended it at his last episode. The actual ending was so mundane
Season 1 and 2 toby is lowkey the best character on the show
Yea but he’s a writer, no? Wouldn’t he get credit for episodes he wrote but didn’t act in? 
Season 1 Michael would have been pissed but Season 6 Michael wouldn't have cared because he loved Holly and was excited for their future. 
If u like the office then ur probably that annoying friend who never shuts up about the office 
But he’s still not verified on Twitter
Wasn’t the guy who played Toby also the director/writer?

Edit: my bad he was a producer not the director
I must have blacked all those Ellie Kemper appearances out. She was the absolute worst cast member. Even just seeing her face makes me angry. 
Dwight is in every episode. Jim is in every episode but he is just a phone voice in one of them. Pam is credited on IMDb for every episode but it looks like she isn't in 4 of them and she is just a phone voice in a couple others. Stanley, Kevin, Angela, and Phyllis seemingly are in every episode as well.
And Jim too?
This is probably just the middle of the list 
Dwight “Ironman” Schrute 
It's practically impossible not to read this in Michael's voice.
I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.
This episode was on CC yesterday!
I just feel so sad for Toby. He really doesn't deserve the shit he gets from Michael.
For some reason, reading it in text form helps put into perspective how brutal that really was lmao. A lot of Michael-to-Toby quotes could qualify for /r/murderedbywords 
Yea but Michael had two dates, so, did he really beat him?
And in Fun Run
It felt good to take money from Michael.  
...I'm gonna chase that feeling. 
He's only in two more seasons than her and one of those is the shorter first season.
She first appeared in episode 88, so there are 87 episodes that Michael appears in that she doesn't. Michael leaves 51 episodes before the end but appears in the finale, so there are 50 episodes Erin is in that Michael isn't. 87-50=37.
And was Darryl really in that many? He doesn't become a major character until a few seasons in.
Also wasn’t John Krasinski in every episode except for one? Why isn’t he above Paul?
<Spoiler> Michael left in S7
Yes but he wasnt in 2 seasons
Damn, you beat me to it.
You can line them up shoulder to shoulder and shot all three at once thru the neck.
Too far Michael. 
That is seriously one of the most hilarious lines of the entire series
Just as hot as Jan but in a different way.
Might be that IMDB counts the double episodes as one.
Yeah, and you're telling me that Jim and Pam aren't even in the top four?
According to Wikipedia there's 201 episodes, but IMDB says there's only 188, so there's a difference somewhere that'd explain that.
This is actually really funny, lol. 
I blame Kevin. 
Keleven
Michael was filmed way more than Toby
I thought rajiniganda was a boys name
I always got the impression she went by Erin and didn't want to be the one called Kelly
 When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine and watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole godforsaken world I wanna hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
OP has scrolled to where Toby and Michael are. Jim, Pam and Dwight would be to the left if you were to scroll over
Jim, Pam, Dwight, Stanley, Kevin, Angela, and Phyllis are all in 188 episodes, so no Erin isn't in more episodes than Jim or Pam. But this doesn't suggest otherwise, Toby is 14th on the list.
Carell got a bunch of movie parts and didn't have time for the show, personality my least liked character so I was cool with it.
Hey, AlvinGT3RS, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Nooo you may be thinking of BJ Novak (Ryan), executive producer and sometimes writer. Mindy Kaling (Kelly) was also a writer for the show 
Pam is missing for three episodes when she goes on leave from her second pregnancy 
I know for sure Phyllis wasn't in every episode, she missed a couple after her wedding.
He wasn't on camera in the Mafia episode when Jim and Pam went on their honeymoon. idk if that counts though lol
Come along, afterthought.
Only episode he wasn't on camera and didn't have lines was the new year's resolution episode, only mention of him is his resolution to bike more


What about Kevin, Phylis, and Stanley?
This guy imdb's
Identity theft is not a joke, /u/chach_86. Millions of families suffer every year.
The Jamaicans don't have a word for "impossible"
Well that's because it's a quote by Michael.
It’s practically impossible to read this and not laugh
Is he a full-on rapist though?
Probably not, Kemosabe. 
After watching it a million times, I think he does.  He’s pathetic first off. Second off, he abuses his power for his own benefit while always giving people shit about breaking rules.  He’s a whiney child when he bitches a Daryl for selling cookies to Kevin.  He goes after taken women.  I used to share the opinion, bout over time I’ve come to dislike him as much as Michael.  
He does when you realize he’s the Scranton strangler.
Managers hating HR reps is an on going theme in the office.Even Wallace hated his HR rep.
Two queens on Casino Night....I’m gonna drop a deuce on everybody. 
Who knows how many ones Toby had as a Scranton Strangler?
He didn't beat him, he bet him. 
"Ooh look at me I'm Toby I'm stretching" why is he even here?
Yep. 
And the shorter 4th season.
Even with this condition it doesn't make much sense


Edit It does, I'm just really dumb
r/theydidthemath 
Wrong. Michael leaves one or two episodes before the end.


Actually I think he appeared in the last one, afterwards there was a spin off series called The Office as well, it was good  but not nearly the original with Steve Carrell.
He's probably not a major character in most of them, but he's in a lot of the season like 2-5 episodes briefly or as part of a crowd.
I mean, I don’t think Paul appeared in the most episodes out of everyone, it’s just how the screen cap was taken. Jim, Pam and Dwight would be leading the chart 
This isn't the beginning of the list. There are 13 characters who were in more episodes than Toby. 
That is not enough of a spoiler warning
Wait he doesnt come back in season 9, fuck I was hoping it was just a one season hiatus oh well
Seriously, fuck you dude. I'm literally in the process of watching the series for the first time and I'm on S07E017.
That's what she said
I'd curve the bullet
Yeah that line is absolutely brutal, but I get the feeling I've heard is somewhere else before so I'm not sure if Michael is quoting something. Either way, brutal line and brutal delivery as he isn't joking. 
That's a good point. 
This is correct. I built www.ratetheoffice.com using IMDB data and the episode count differs from Netflix for this reason.
We are all double episodes on this blessed day
Oh god this is like a star trek how many episodes thing 
This isn’t the top of the list. [According to IMDb](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/)  Jim, Pam, Stanley, Kevin, Angela, Dwight, and Phyllis all appeared in 188 episodes, with Meredith at 187 and creed at 180
Per the wiki "Until "The Inner Circle", the character Michael Scott had appeared in every episode." Inner circle is episode 149


They are. This is further down the list. 
Yea I think it's because there are some double episodes through the shows run. Some sources treat them as one episode others treat them as two thus the discrepancy
If you multiply by keleven, the math checks out. 
Hey, he is mentally challenged!
Okay, but what if we made it pies instead of episodes?
So you can do math when it comes to cookies?
A mistake plus keleven gets you home by 7
Lol thanks for the lesson in semantics???
Lmao
Gilbert Gottfried? 
Oh gotcha that makes sense. I don't know how imdb works. I feel dumb now haha
Hes my favourite so far but Dwight's also pretty great too.
How on Earth did you even like the show then? Lol
The guy who played Toby wrote/co-wrote 16 épisodes and was one of the shows producers as well. He was the main producer from seasons 5 to 8. 
Did they both really have parts in every episode where they were in NY and/or working for that sports agency?
That’s right. I remember she wasn’t in the house party episode in season 8 with Robert 
I think his voice was in it over the phone right? That would probably give him credit in the episode 
Only episode he wasn't on camera and didn't have lines was the new year's resolution episode, only mention of him is his resolution to bike more
I guess I shouldn't browse this reddit before finishing the show :/
He spoke. Hmmmm tricky one.
MICHAEL!!
Misquoting is not a joke, Jim!
Yes they do, it’s “impossible”
What is this, a crossover episode?
Analrapist possibly, because he does do counseling.
How much cheese is too much cheese? 
I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn't back down from anybody and he likes to call people kemosabe
Hmmmmmm
Yeah, but none of those are the reasons Michael picks on him. I think you're both right.
Especially that one time he put his hand on Pam's knee, jumped a fence and then fled to Costa Rica
Not to mention he’s the Scranton strangler.
Also he probably strangled people
>I used to share the opinion, bout over time I’ve come to dislike him as much as Michael.

You dislike MICHAEL?
Also he’s a murderer and should be in jail. 
Ugh, Kendall is the worst.
Lmao and they tried to poison him but accidentally helped his stomach issues.
Time to carbo load!
Assuming each season is roughly 25 episodes. 1 full season plus the first season (which is like 6 episodes) is 31. The seasons vary in length so I guess it's possible.
r/theydidthemonstermath
<Spoiler> he comes back in s9 for a lil bit </Spoiler>
And yet here you are on this subreddit hoping that you won't accidentally come across any spoilers for a show that's been off the air for years. 🙄
How did you not know this? It was advertised and talked about like crazy when it was happening...
Its like 10 years old... spoilers?
[deleted]
Yeah. I'm in the same situation and I had no idea that he was going to leave.
What’s with the downvotes?
You'd curve the bullet to hit Toby twice with each bullet right?
Like in my favorite James Macavoy film Wanted.
GOOD point
Gah please don't advertise Office websites I can't access yet.
This made me laugh too much, unexpected but welcome. 
How the hell is Creed in so many? 
Astounding how many people are struggling with this.
A mistake plus keleven gets you home by seven
Wait...do you think I’m retarded?
He was home by 4:45 that day
Haha no problem dude
I'd have to re-watch but it seemed like they always found an excuse for Jim to talk to Pam on the phone. Or Jim talking to David Wallace on the phone. 
Actually I think the problem was that he didn't have any credit in that episode.
"Just *fake static* and you'll be saved"
What about the farm episode?
He speaks with pam on the phone in that episode.
Oh that's funny. MICHAEL!!

Whose side are you on Toby?
Michael clearly is able to pick up on all of this without even realizing. It's just innate
I just watched that episode this week and it never fails to skeeve me out. Like, I got chills thinking about the way he strokes her knee slightly with his thumb. http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/jim.gif
michael is a fun character and all, but if i met someone like that irl, i would probably start planning how to ghost them 5 minutes into meeting them.
Michael is a terrible person with few if any redeeming qualities. Wanting people to like you in and of itself is not a positive quality, and it's really the best one he's got. The only time that vaguely changes is in the last few episodes before he leaves and that just seemed like a blatant attempt to make the audience remember the character like they remember the actor. 
No, you misunderstood.  I dislike home Toby as much as Michael hates him.  
Season 4 was cut short to 19 episodes due to the writer's strike.
It glorifies the occult

Seriously. You have to be actively stupid to browse the subreddit of a show you havent finished

Just finished a rewatch and if you count the one episode with his voice Jim’s in every episode 
Underrated Reply
I don’t get it
Oh no do you think somebody stole it?
Did this to my cousin the other day when he called me with a simple work problem (I no longer work at the company and he does): "oh your internet's not working? All you have to do is *silence* and you'll be fine." "What was that jimmy? Your phones breaking up." "Just *garbled sounds* and you'll be saved." And I hung up in hysterics.
Are you talking the last season? Packer goes to Philly and gives him and Darryl a cupcake
When? Maybe a deleted scene or something, I don't remember him being there or having any lines in S7ep13 Ultimatum
Every god damn thread 
This gave me an actual headache
What gives you the right?
Michael, for all his faults, is extremely well meaning and cares about the others in the office like they are his family (they're basically all he has until he meets his soup snake). He just knows there is something wrong with Toby and that's why he hates him. It may be that they later decided to justify Michael's hatred by planting clues that Toby is the Scranton Strangler.

Michael even likes Todd Packer, the most outwardly horrible character, up until Holly points out what an awful person Todd is. 
The thing with shows like this is that the characters are far more sympathetic within the context of the world they live in, but in real life they would be objectively awful people. Michael does a bunch of stuff that would be hard to socially recover from. 
I know I know. Just making a dumb joke based on the wording of it. 
There was a strike?
Because it’s fucking played out and was never funny to begin with. 
Or just...not care about spoilers? I browse this sub and I haven’t finished the show yet. Not sure why really, every post/comment is one of ~25 regurgitated scenes/lines
The comment section isn't though ya goof
Well don't look at the comments then, dummy
LPT: proactively block subreddits of shows you're currently binging to avoid spoilers. I do this all the time. 
Did y'all live under a rock?
Yeah. How dare anybody who hasnt watched every episode look at a post on reddit.  HOW DARE THEY!
I feel better now.
>Reddit is a weird place ~~sometimes~~

Oh, holly, that is very offensive 
He's only in the cold open in this episode:

Kevin got Jim’s credit card account locked. 
Stolen identity is a key element of this particular episode.
Right, my bad I have been binge watching extended versions for so long that assumed that scene could be in the standard version. It's a deleted scene
Yeah you're right a deleted scene.

>Michael, for all his faults, is extremely well meaning and cares about the others in the office like they are his family (they're basically all he has until he meets his soup snake)

I just can't agree with this. Michael never cared about other people, he cared about other people caring about them and there is a *huge* difference. He never did genuinely kind things. He only threw tantrums and acted like a petulant child every time someone didn't want to be his besty. Wanting people to like you doesn't necessarily make you likeable.
It was part of the overall writers union strike, most tv shows were affected. Conan was doing ridiculous segments like "watch how long this top spins" because he didn't want to do any skits without his writers.
It really wasn’t that well known until he announced it in the show. NBC wasn’t running commercials screaming it from the rooftops and most people don’t look at actor news for shows or anything. 
I mean if they don’t want possible spoilers to an eight year old episode then...
That's not the issue, it's being here and then complaining about spoilers.
I mean I tend to avoid subs for shows I’m not caught up on or haven’t finished. If you’re on the subreddit for a show and haven’t caught up don’t complain about spoilers, you know the risk you’re taking 
Dont whine about spoilers

Also its not even a spoiler. They announced it before it happened
Still would count though, since that is part of the episode 
Now, THIS is underrated.
Classic
And about twice as many upvotes as its parent comment
He finally learned that identity theft isn’t a joke. 
Actually it’s not. You’re thinking of a different episode. Stolen identity is not the same as a stolen credit card, and no other themes of stolen identity are present. The mob is, and Andy/Dwight play characters, but there is no identity theft. This isn’t the episode with the cold open about identity theft either.
People empathize with Michael because deep down a lot of people are basically Michael. Most people are really only capable of reading the story of their lives from their own point of view. Michael, like many of us, has a gaping hole in his ability to earnestly evaluate himself. 
I stopped forgiving Michael the second he threw the Woody doll in the trash...
Did their strike accomplish anything

Okay.
ok Toby
I completely agree. I think Michael was supposed to show us that, but a lot of people seem to see it as a validation of their own flaws rather than a call to question them.
It ruined Heroes.
Hard to tell for any of us who aren't a part of that union. 
Exposed shitty labor practices? 
Yeah they reached a contract with the studios that the writers union agreed to. The biggest part of the dispute was that they wanted a better deal for residuals when their shows end up on Netflix or similar websites/apps. I don’t know the details of it all but they were able to get at least some of what they were asking for by striking. 
Underrated reply
They could save the cheerleader, but not the show. 
The original plan they had for season two had a lot of promise.... shame really.



The writer's strike did help Supernatural though, so there's that.
To be fair, Heroes was on a downward tragectory long before the writer's strike. 
What are the issues with being a writer
Nice
That is correct.
