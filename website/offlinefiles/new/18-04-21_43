Babies hugging and patting each others' back.

I love how respectfully wait until the other ones finish to start a new hug.
They look like their company just made a huge sale. 
Why are they all the same baby
*Dr...Dr.....Dr...Dr..*
My friends and I after a night out where no one ended up in the hospital

Celebration? Check. 

Participants are not yet mature? Check. 

Tell me if I’m doing this wrong; I think this is a /r/PrematureCelebration
They all look exactly alike to me.

I know this does not fit in that sub, since baby are humans. But the huggings and back pattings are just very adult-like
This is what leaving big family gatherings is like
Aww, I bet they’re copying what they’ve seen the adults do!
I can't imagine how exhausting caring for four babies must be, but this video makes me feel like I *need* four babies. 
The real teletubbies
It’s like they’re celebrating the successful cloning process 
this is so cute
Someone science-y who knows about babies explain this to me. Are they just mimicking adult behavior or is hugging like instinctual? How early do they start mimicking adult behavior? Also how old are these babies? 
Babies are like tiny drunk people, just oblivious and happy. 
Soooo much love 😍 
One holds their hands behind their back waiting lol...adorable!! Pure hug <3
This is creepy. Like watching aliens practice being human 
They just closed a big deal.  These are business babies.   
Am I the only one that immediately thought of [this gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/VN1FNL6Lqc0vu/giphy.gif)
My eyes are leaking 
This is one of the most adorable things I've ever seen. 
I could watch this for hours.
I’m gonna sit back and let my associate Ryan Howard do the talking
Nobody show this to my wife. She will want more babies, and I don't want any more babies.
I was walking to work the other day.  I walked by a couple who were audibly fighting and cursing each other out.  The man was pushing a small child that couldn't have been much older than this in a stroller.  The child looked so innocent, but I knew him growing up in the environment is probably going to make him not a great person, and it made me feel sad. 
I see the junior branch of Cosa Nostra are meeting to discuss the latest "Diaper situation".
They remind me of a bunch of old people 
They look like they just arrived at a family reunion and are greeting each other after not seeing each other for years. 

“Nice to see you, Karen, it’s been a while.” 
“You too, Sharron, this is my daughter, Casey.”
Love is contagious. 
Oh man im glad to see you in this life. 
Weeelll... thanks, Jack. It's been a great evening! Tell Janine to join us the next time! And, oh, thanks for the Jack Daniels. You didn't have to.
It’s  like watching tiny mob bosses agreeing to some massive cocaine deal.
they just beat the babies down the block in a bottle drinking competition and are congratulating eachother.
We grow up to be such weirdos 
They're up to something, baby mafia
Hey congrats! We made it this far!
It must be hot in here because my eyes are sweaty. 
Crtl+c ctrl+v
Couldn't help but think of seeing this as a combined gif with the babies changing into wrestlers that turn these into bear hugs and body slams.
<3
Awww that is so cute! I'm so glad I don't have one this young any more though. I like them to be able to just say, hey Mom my ear hurts instead of screaming until you can get them to the doctor.
That kid in the pink short sleeve is smart. Always gets both underhooks. 
Video feed of Tumblr.
"And so begins the 1st annual Baby Summit. How is our hold on Argentina? Have the wealth redistributions been effective in destabilizing the proletariate?"
I want one now. 
Looks like the closing scene in my kitchen after my wife and her friends have wine night. 
"Carol! That was an epic load you just made! Congratulations!"

"You too Steve. I heard it from across the room!"

"And Anne! That diaper looks like it's about to burst! Well done!" 
It’s like post game hugs, Good game..  good game..  
Seems like every family reunion.
It's like they're little people
Lollipop Guild Reunion 
It's like they just finished a trade deal for rusks and milk rations 
They’re like little aliens
My last 4 brain cells 
Detective here. The babies are recreating the scene they just witnessed of adults greeting each other at a Christmas or New Years party. Notice the lights from the decorations can be observed in the background in the reflection of the window. [Also, notice the date of the source file here is Jan 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMmzc_WhUmQ)—just after New Years.
The original cast of teletubbies
OP, Did you really spell Chandragupta Maurya as that ??😂
Me every time I get drunk with my buddies. 
These are the first four time travelers who successfully sent their consciousnesses back to the bodies of their former selves.

Little do they know that as the human brain develops at this early age it will slowly wipe their memories of their former lives until they are nothing more than slightly precocious children. In 48 years they will once again send their minds back, in an infinite loop that they have no idea they are trapped in.
Anyone knows, what are those chain of lights out of the window?
Those aare sisters i bet
r/likeus
Are they quadruplets? 
Some people should never develop beyond this. 
For some *strange* reason I'm reminded of the Teletubbies...

**BIG HUG!**
I feel like I've got double vision , 8 kids!!!
I wish the world was like this.
The end of every AA meeting.
Good job babies, good job.. 
They're quadruplets and have just driven their mother to stress cry.
when you meet your pack after the test and realise that they too will be taking the test again next year..
They're evolving.
'Peace be with you'

'and also with you'
Are they in space?
I love the disney songs in the background Alessia Cara is my fav.
Looks like they're celebrating a big merge in the company 🤣
just another day at the office
They’re comforting each other knowing it’s all downhill from there
Aaaand now I want another baby. Or four. ‘Honey! You don’t mind getting un-snipped right?’
Is this a learned behavior or is there something deep in our brains that tells us to pat others on the back?
Can someone photo shop these cuties as businessmen who just closed out a huge deal?
Absolutely adorable 
This is eye bleach of the highest potency. 
Yet another example of toddlers behaving just like drunk old men. 
Sweet.
The end of literally every family gathering 
Next thing you know, Reptar is wrecking your shit.

Hi should be #1 on r/all every day. 
Babies freak me out 
These are definitely girls 
get them hooked young
To top it all off, by the look of those lights outside it’s also Christmas time.
So cut
When you score a goal in houseleague.
Imagine them in suits
clones...
They are identical quads from Alberta, Canada. No fertility treatments. I follow their Facebook page. 
This is the Teletubbies in real life 
This is so wholesome. I love how they re-hug while waiting to change the hug combinations too 
This is so sweet...this is why people want children. Little do they realize.....
Best thing I have ever seen on the internet 
They've totally witnessed this at a family gathering or something. 
Rugrats irl
what a huggy huggy day... i am tired already
"Charlie! It's been forvever hasn't it? How's the wife and kids?"
Next week on Facebook:

WHEN THE BARTENDER SAY LAST CALL
what in the living fuck?
These babies have better social skills than I do. 
The world would be a better place is we all greeted one another this way. 
This was just too cute.
It's funny how tiny kids who can't talk still get along and communicate. My parents tell me stories of me from daycare when I wasnt even 2 and I had best friends that I loved. Babies are so interesting
Looks like they're inspired from Teletubbies
Omg..can I get in on some of those hugs??
I don't know why but this makes me laugh so hard
They are so proud their investment made a profit
They look like Teletubbies! I wonder which one is the gay purple one 
Demons from hell
Hmm did not know that "Skull & Bones" started this early.

It’s like The Sopranos with babies 
Someone has taught them patting is an important part in hugging
Good work ol' chap.
New rugrats season looks great
The dark windows studded with lights makes me feel like this is taking place on a spaceship in deep space for some reason...
Eyebleach? This is the creepiest thing I’ve ever seen.
I immediately started hearing them all speak in deep goodfellas voices. "Aay... 'ow you doin?" "Hayuh-doin!" "Aaaaay! How yuh doin!?!"
I love how easy it is for children to make friends and be so lovey, for a while whenever I would pick up my son from daycare he would have to hug all his friends goodbye and it was some of the cutest shit I've ever seen. Every time I take him to the playground he finds at least one kid that he clings to and it's his best friend for the short amount of time we're there, I wish it was that easy as an adult, just walk up to someone and be their friend immediately, no judgement, no questions, just friends right off the bat.
this is the cutest god damn thing in the universe. My girlfriend wont stop squeeling.

They look like Italian mobsters after not seeing each other for a while 
Seeing so many babies together is like seeing a bunch of Ferrari Enzos parked next to each other. 
I like how they go after the one that kinda wandered off like “no get back here you little shit, you don’t get out of this!” 
Does everyobody see that these are "heart Hugs?"  Hugs where you hug on the right side.  Most people do not hug on the right.

Try a heart hug.  Babies know.

[Source video is funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMmzc_WhUmQ), they all make the same sound to initiate a hug request lol
Talk about gentlebabies. 
2 years later they kick the crap out of each other because of a cheerio
Reminded me of the Sims.
An then sadly they grow up. 
It was actually just a hug sale 
Came here to say this. Clearly this is one of their penthouse suites and they’re celebrating a successful merger. A Gerber Merger
They did a business!
This might be the scene they are role playing.   It very clear they are mimicking the behavior they have seen in adults when they are happy.    My money is they are roleplaying the typical greeting of adults as they show up for a dinner party.  
Congrats on the acquisition Braden.  Aiden, Zooey, Kayden, and I couldn’t be more pleased.  You’re gonna go far at this company.  What say we all take a quick nap and convene in my office after for binkies?  
I'm just imagining them all congratulating each other on a successful mission or something.
They remind me of a stock photo of guys in suits shaking hands

Babies'll do that.
I was thinking Boss Baby irl
BABY ARE HUMANS!?
Past life. They forget it after like 2 or 3. I bet these babies were drinking buddies in a past life.
Babies are so much smarter than many people think. It's pretty amazing actually.
That one baby represents the guy who walked out to his car but some cousin still followed him out there to keep him from leaving with inane conversation. 
This is actually 100% correct.  We always pick up the baby and pat his back.  We do this without even thinking.  We realized that when I gave my wife a hug and started patting her on the back.
Start with one baby, then build your collection slowly.
It’s a trap 
I have been thinking about starting an army....
I'm turning 30 next month, and just had some health issues that might prevent ever having children. This video definitely made me feel like I need 4 babies too. 
>I need four babies.

I can help you with that (;
These babies are probably just under 18 months and yes, the behaviour is absolutely learned.  
These babies look 16-18 mos old to me, but they are quadruplets. It’s a high risk pregnancy so they could have delivered earlier and be older but not look it. Babies start mimicking pretty early, like 3 mos. I wonder if hugging is instinctual? I think it may be more behavioral because some cultures hug more than others. 
Did anyone notices the left one in the pink keeps hugging the same one?
These babies are probably about a year and a half old, and as for the hugging, a little bit of both? My son used to hug my head, because the embrace was instinctual for someone he loves, but I had to teach him to hug in a more socially acceptable way. And they start mimicking what they see literally as soon as they can control their limbs 
Judging by the Christmas lights I would assume their family and they saw the adults giving each other hugs goodbye and just started mimicking them.
Literally describes babies in general.
/r/certainlynotaliens
Babies act similarly to very drunk old men.  
Zuckerberg effect 
I’m getting some uncanny valley vibes
They work for Baby Corp
I chuckled, then I got uncomfortable, then I stayed uncomfortable.
Ooooo what a cute babyyyyy! So precious!
My wife and I have had two *extremely* exuberant boys, and I think that has put her off babies forever now
sahi pakde hain. 

Yep.
Looks like shrubs decorated with Christmas light strings. The wind is making the bounce around. 
Those are not lights. They're on the Enterprise and it's a Star trek episode.
watch boss baby
You must have been downvoted a lot as a child.  Or dropped a few times as a baby.  There there.
Eh! Ehhaaaoooowwww
It's like irl minecraft villagers
It’s learned behaviour. They are copying their family. The sound the make is them trying to copy “Hello”

I'm losing my shit because they're not getting equal number of hugs.
That’s adorable times four!
Only to run into eachother again on Black Friday...
And business appears to be booming.

You deserve more upvotes
Always nice when a big project comes together after a long day at the Business Factory!
isn’t this a movie
Those babies look at least a couple weeks away from being able to work out the quad. They can barely stand up, let alone do some squats with weights.

Could've fooled me.

Or maybe they saw someone else do it in *this* life 
They’re kinda like dogs in the sense that they can be extremely smart but can’t express it in a way that adult humans can really understand. 
A friend of mine chatting at a dinner party reached over to another adults plate and absent mindedly began cutting his food into small pieces
One time at Target I saw a lady buying the last one I needed, so when she wasn't looking I grabbed it from her cart and got it myself.
how?
Watch the video, that one pink baby is ignored by the other two babies in white.
Hugging is not instinctual. I once met a grandparent raising her grandchild from age 2.5; she said that when the child came into her home she had no idea what hugs and kisses were :(

These babies know how to hug because they are in a loving, nurturing household where this behavior is modeled and practiced frequently. 
#Z'Traxu, is the what the terrans call "hugging"

"I believe so my lord Kl'gar"

#"Do they enjoy it"

"Very much so my lord"

#Then as shall we. Embrace me Z'Traxu


Same motor function
I wish someone would shoot me with a bull tranquilizer.
Yeah quite likely, thanks 
PHONETICALLY.
In that you'll burn down their village and steal their meat and flowers?
Nah this is teletubbies
Speculative 
That's unlikely.  Usually the people you say "hello" to are not the same ones you hug.  Actually saying "hello" is pretty formal.


I personally think they're saying versions of hug ("huuuuh", "uuuug").  But I'm just a specialist in childhood language development.
We were voyagers!!
I like that movie an embarrassing amount.

I don't know man babies have better squat form than most people I see in the gym
Oh hell no
That just brought a lot of nostalgia. The peeing one was so funny to me as a kid.
Or worse, expelled.
Or jail again.
i can't figure out what would be more terrifying; your firstborns being quads and now you need to raise 4 children at once even though it's your first time, or you already one or two kids and now you have 5-6
How do you know they're quads?

Also - Jesus, 1 is scary. 4 at once? Phew.

Nonsense, it must be reincarnation!
Teach them sign language
[The similarities are uncanny.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvwTyESiR0)
this is...hilarious. how did that go over? 
Instinct is real
I’d be like well if you fucking started it might as well finish I’m spoiled now I NEED SMALL FOOD
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I get the argument, but is it a possibility that hugs and kisses are learned behavior that are associated with kindness, nurturing, loving, and support? So is it possible that that baby that had no idea what hugs and kisses were could have (in theory) found another means of kindness? Like hand holding, face touching, or just eye contact? 
Just one? 😋
Duh.
You’re right, babies are naturally born with the instinctual hugging and patting on the back that we practiced in the wild millions of years ago /s.
Someone doesn't have Irish family.
Literally impossible to like that movie too much 
Just Monika
The only one with blue on him. It's like an elephant or something on the left side of the white pajama with pink trim.
It’s your turn this time. 
That's adorably terrifying. 
Title in video on YouTube :)
My aunt treaches all her kids sign language! It helps them communicate before they can speak. I think she said their speech brains don't kick in before their communicating brains do. So giving them a tool to communicate actually helps them learn to speak faster!
Or teach them to speak like we've always done. 
Even better, teach them to speak! Unless you're talking about dogs
yes indeed. 
What's speculative is the "hello" bit. 
I mean chimps do it
Buying a stroller that seats 4 is adorably terrifying.

Having 4 kids that will need to pay college tuition in 18 years is considerably less adorable, but still terrifying.
Well of course you should teach them to speak too but they can learn to sign at a much younger age than they can speak. It’s really helpful to communicate with them before they have the ability to talk. 
You’re onto something here...
I think they grew up in a family of mobsters that all say 'oo!' like Paulie Walnuts when they see each other. 
Yep... Signing did wonders for my parents and I when my siblings were infants. 
If these babies start pointing with their pinkies and index fingers I’ll be convinced.
I was thinking Italian.
