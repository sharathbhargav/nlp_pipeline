Fixing his hair before he wears a hat

Y'all can't behave so we've had to lock this thread. 
I wear a hat when I don't want to do anything with my hair. This kids ambitious.
I like how he does a full 360 to flip his bangs into place before putting on the hat
Can't just put that hat on *any* head.
Tf was that twirl at the end there😂
Let him preen.  The joys of being young with flowing head of hair.  His thoughts are elsewhere.
Hats are like hair straighteners. When you pull them off your hair is set into the position you left it. 

This kid is in 3018 when we are all living in 2018.
From someone who still does this (I'm 30 btw), may I explain...

So, my hair is incredibly thick and I live in the humid south. I love how my hair looks when it's partially wet, but when it dries, it poofs out like a Jewish fro and it becomes wayyyy too big. So, I usually wet my hair a bit, style it the way I want, and then I put a hat on to actually mat it down for about 30 minutes. Think of it as a white man's do-rag.
I wonder how long it took him to pick out that t shirt and jeans he has on
At least he cares about what he looks like.
As someone who is very into their hair, you have to set up the hair under the hat, as the hat is an accessory that you may want to take off. 
Lol, you all acting like you're so much better because you think he's wasting time fixing his hair. Yo, you all just watched some kid fix his hair and somehow think you're the one who's more efficient. Gotcha.
He looks like a younger Superman from Smallville
That kid is cute. 
I find this to be weirdly adorable
ITT: sweaty neckbeards bashing someone more attractive than them
This is hard to watch from an outside perspective but I do this....wet hair gets curly if left to air dry, the hat keeps it down and holds its shape. 
When I had hair, I did that. 
“Ok, spin move..then hat!” “Go!”
At first I thought “oh that’s not that weird! I do that to avoid hat hair” and then I thought “*oh* ok now what the hell is this nonsense”
Sick flow bro
hehe haha this guy cares about what he looks like unlike US, am i right boys??? what a doof
That was so suspenseful!
What a cute young guy during a sweet private moment. 
what the hell is in his pocket tho
As a mom of teenage boys. I'm sorry, but this is adorable.
Aw, that's really sweet.
I can relate. I fix my hair. Then I mash it into a messy bun. 
He's *actually unreal*
I like that fake out at the end there
Not everyone does this? Im a female that does this. I'm not tryna have a bird's nest if I decide to take the hat off later
ITT, you can tell who does this same damn thing.
Equivalent to a dog going in several circles before lying down.
The comments here are surprisingly tame/nice.
Nothing wrong with a little vanity. 
Classic Schmosby.
This dude fucks
thought I was on /r/gaybros for a quick minute
The question that needs answering:
Which of these two sports does he play, Lacrosse or hockey?
Of course he puts it on backwards.


What is the point though?
I don't know why but I find this just so damn cute and adorable.
In middle school, this girl would dab off the grease from her pizza, and the pull the cheese off and eat the crust and sauce only. Pretty much the same thing.
10/10 would smash
You have to fix the hair, then put the hat on bc the hat preserves the hair so when u take it off u don't have hat hair. A step ahead!! 
All girls fix their hair before putting on a hat....
Why does concern over his appearance make him gay?There's nothing about this video that gives any of us any information on his sexuality.

Let's just leave it at the fact that this he's really out here tryin and that's more than a lot of us can say for ourselves lol
Jesus that was hard to watch... 
IT'S IN CASE SOMEONE FORCES HIM TO TAKE HIS HAT OFF, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE
it’s because if you put your hat on the wrong way and then decide you want to take it off, your hair will look ridiculous. I’ve experienced the struggle
Sometimes I miss being young and giving a shit. 
I’d do that if I had hair
Lmao I do this.
Interesting how the images posted to /r/whitepeoplegifs features a person being the object of ridicule. Who made this sub and who's pushing content like this to the front page, and why?
I feel like this video came out of Canada.
All that work, then he throws on an adjustable hat. 
Maybe he was deciding whether or not he was going to put on the hat and after messing with his hair for a bit and realizing it wasn’t working, he just decided to throw on the hat.
When your hockey bro acts like your sister getting ready to club it up on Friday night.
ITT a lot of bitter people. Yeah, it's silly but... why all the hate?
[removed]
So handsome
What's wrong with that? It means he cares about himself enough to groom himself lol.
People used to do that for even going out shopping.
Now people don't care as much, either because they're too busy or don't feel motivation to do so.
Hello, young chad.
American Psycho
He's either the gayest of the gay or the straighest of the straight Idk which 
I have a friend that would put gel in his hair, style it (comb to the side) then put his hat on. 

Yes, we are still friends. 
If you put a hat with your hair scrambled, you couldn't take away cause it will be 10 times worse,
He looks like a young Daniel Tosh
If you are someone with long hair you are probably going to just put it in a bun before putting in a hat. But yeah this kid did nothing 😄
I have seen my sons do the same thing, baffles the mind. 
Isn't that normal ? When you take the cap of, the hair is still at the somewhat same place where you left it. He milks it tho.
r/madlads
Bro mode executed!
My damn boyfriend does this
He must be destroyed!
Ted Mosby esque
I understand fixing your hair so it’s all in the hat and out of your face but damn
Is he working on a mullet?
This is me!
Hair will contour to whatever shape it was in after he puts the hat on. He just wants to make sure his hair will still look good if he ever needs to take the hat off. 

 
Hey I found someone with the same hair as me
I wear a hat because I’m  folichily  challenged and sun hurts.
This is something i see all the time, helps stop you having messy hair when you finally take your hat off
The little spin before the end.  Like he need to psych himself up just a bit more before tackling a great fear. 
Why I shave my hair. I found myself wasting too much energy and time doing this shit. 
As a white guy, can confirm. While I don’t do what this kid did. I usually just move my hair the side so my hat doesn’t sit uncomfortably on my head. Other than that I’m not brushing it and making sure it’s flawless. 
Nah this makes sense. I have to make sure my hair is set a certain way before I put hat so it doesn’t look absolutely insane when I take the hat off. 
I wear a hat because of a genetic abnormality that is causing it to recede from my skull and sprout down my back like it’s leaving hairy breadcrumbs for sexually daring elves in search of the fabled assbush.
Having once been a teen girl and knowing the stress of having the perfect hair, it is reassuring to know teen boys suffered too.
Is that Chad from SAE?
I feel like this most definitely a white thing
I would do this, but with a beanie when I was 18. I have very wavy hair, and I hated it, so the hat would calm it down. But not before I would spend way too long styling and putting in product! 
There should be a subreddit exclusively for things like this. See also the lady tasting her soup while seasoning it without dipping her spoon back in and the momma rocking the empty crib while holding her baby.

Is that a banana in his pocket or is he happy to see you? 
I do the same thing. My hair is too long to have bangs but then I give myself this weird backwards reverse combover to get bangs, then hold it in place with a hat.
This totally real and not staged post brought to you by the most online guy ever 
My friend did the opposite once. He was a little drunk and his parents came home, he goes "oh shit!" and puts a ball cap on his wild hair, pulls it off and it looked normal again. 
Dude kept flipping his hair and redoing it, come on man.
It happens to me too, I spend like 15 mins trying to make my hair perfect only to put a hat over it. It's just muscle memory.
I don’t know why, but this kid REALLY annoys me. 
who can see the hair under the cap?
TIL Im not supposed to fix my hair before I wear a hat
Douche level over 9000
20 bucks says the thing in his right pocket is a brush so he can fix his hair while he's on the go.

hey, that's Chad! 

Looks like [Eddie Redmayne](https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F03%2F14001852%2FEddie-Redmayne.jpg&w=700&q=85)
Lol he’s like fuck it my hair is fucked I’ll just wear a hat
I'm a hatmon myself but I'll only ever play with the hair that'll end up showing. Preening the front only to tuck it seems pointless. 
Does he have a banana in his pocket? 
That’s like brushing ur teeth before eating an onion.
My hair line is moving farther back than a hat will even affect
must be that none of y’all understand the best way to avoid hat hair is the hair prep... style points for the spin around fakey he’s an OG pick up artist
Ayy I do this too. 

Spend a min fucking with my hair... the say nah and just throw a beanie on.

My hair is curly af.. impossible to make it do anything 
Fuckin sea doo's a hundy p, buddy.
so what
Dictionary definition of vanity.
I would’ve thought this was weird, but last semester there was a guy who sat in front of me the entire semester and he was the same way. Kind of used to it now. 

Wears a hat no matter what and sometimes he’ll adjust his hat and pick it up and put it back on. His hair was always perfectly combed when it showed for a brief second. 
He better step tht waste of time shit down... 
Superman was a very insecure teen apparently, lmao.
This kid is going places 
Never done that even without putting a hat on
As someone with smooth hair. I don't bother anymore. Wind undoes it as soon as I step outside. 
Yea I am laughing on him now but tommorow it will be spending hour in front of mirror...
That twirl
My elderly mother does this. Just sayin. 
this is the whitest thing i have ever seen 
This is my son and all of his friends. Once the hat comes off there will be another 20 minute hair fixing session. One of my sons friends carries hairspray in his backpack just in case. 
Well that's smart
He’s not gay. 
Never understood the backwards hat american thing.
What a todger.
Is that a wallet in his pocket or is he just happy to see himself? 
This kid is mad!
Damn he’s thick
What a tool. 
Is anybody else’s gaydar going off?

You guys make fun of him, but I be he gets he hottest dudes.
To be fair, as a baseball player, if you don’t fix your hair before you put your hat on, you’re gonna get some crazy hat hair.

That being said, this gentleman is not a baseball player... and he definitely spent waaaay too much time fixing his hair before the hat.
I thought he had a boner :S

Definitely not gay

Well he has to primp and groom before he’s allowed to go to the Bronie convention. 
the hat has an opening on the back, which is now the front.  Not a big deal.. yawn content from yawn submitter
Didn’t think anyone still wore caps backwards.

What a douche.
High school boys are the fucking worst.  So all eight of you are going to splay out in front of the mirror preening for the whole goddamn time I'm in the bathroom?  Like I don't need to check my grill.
Think this is me, anyone got a still of him facing the camera?
Well you have your face and a camera... could start there 
Yea I meant in this gif. You know, to compare it too haha
Wooosh
Who says white people don't have culture?
Sooo white. My white friendships mom used to do that

Not fake, just gay

Why the fuck is your flair *"Jenna-Louise Coleman"*
If you have CSS on it's an image. Also she's great. 
He's dong it for his head. It's very emotionally sensitive and he didn't want it to think it was being neglected. 
If you're planning on taking the hat off at some point this is a good idea.  You just throw the hat on messy hair it's going to be fucked when you take it off.
I wear a hat too
School shooter getting ready to send the kids at school who criticize his morning hair routine to heaven.



:Oh come on. Get the Kombucha outta of your ass and take a joke.
I used to do this cause I had long hair and it sucks having a face full of hair after putting a beanie on
https://gfycat.com/UnequaledFirstAmurstarfish
I think he just forgot he needed to put the hat on.
Dwight Spin Move!
I can't blame him.  When you're that attractive you get to do that.  
You gotta surprise the hair before applying hat. 
If you spin fast enough you can see the back of your head. That’s how he decides to put it on backwards or forwards.
I am not going to "do" the "twirl," alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin.

I might do the spin.
When I was younger and had a beiber hair cut that's how I made it look real swooshy for lack of a better term. I wasn't the only one who did it apparently.

Dude was gonna put the hat on without the mirror but remembered he's too gorgeous to do it mirrorless
Ain't no twirling boys in these parts
He's thinking about big ole anime tiddies.
Oddly poetic
Seriously, there's nothing wrong with wanting to look nice. Maybe he has a date he's nervous about.
#baldlife
Yeah. I remember when I had flowing blonde lockes... days gone by...
With the hindsight of having lost enough to shave it, I wonder what I used to spend all that time fussing over. You see him toss his head, then try to move it around only to have it slide itself back to exactly where it was. Seriously, if you have that much hair just let it do what it wants and get on with your life. Anything you might do to change it is insignificant by comparision to how great it looks just being there.
You know not everyone goes bald.
Meanwhile surreptitiously filming someone in the bathroom makes you a fucking creep. 
That’s exactly what I used to do, back when I had curly hair.
Yup. I've got thick hair that likes to bush up when i don't use product, so smushin it with a hat helped a lot. 
Opposite for me. My hair is extremely impressionable and anything that goes on my head for more than a few minutes leaves its mark until the next time I wash. Over-ear headphones, sunglasses, and especially hats or helmets. 
I put my hat on after applying pomade/gel to flatten it and give my hair time to dry up before I open the car window. It's the only way I don't walk around looking like a wild homeless person the first time I break a sweat. After sweating, I reapply apply the hat or say fuck it and put it in a man bun. 
When my hair gets to long and starts to poof out I where a hat on the way into work to get my hair to stay down.  It stays down all day for the most part and it allows me to put off getting a haircut for a couple of weeks.
This is what I thought.
I do this with beanies almost every day
This kid hairs
My hair is flat. I'll crimp my hair with my hands then put the hat on. That way its textured when I take it off and fix it. Boomshakalaka. Long hair fun.
Yep! I still blow dry my hair so it's generally well kempt whenever I'm going to wear a hat. Don't want to have a bee's nest under there if I decide to take it off at ant point.
I have to do this with damp hair otherwise I get a perm whilst it dries whilst getting dressed.
Fuck. You me? I have the exact same situation. I finally found a product that achieves what we are looking for, without the hat. 

https://www.amazon.com/Sexy-Hair-Control-Maniac-Shine/dp/B00GYGKQTY

Don't be a pussy on how much you put in. We have fucked hair.
this is my hair 
This is exactly what I do.
Bro getchu some burts bees miracle salve.  It's more waxy than most salon-style products.  And you can use it for dry skin, too.  But in hair it basically keeps it tame without looking like anything is in it.  It only takes a tiny amount to get it done.

Pomade don't ever seem to work for me because they try to hold.  I don't want my hair held in place like it's some immobile hair-textured helmet.  And the ones with weak hold still hold just clumps together in whatever shape the pomade dried into.  I want it to drape like it should normally without any product, without frizzing the fuck out from humidity.  So I can tie it up, or let it down, or stuff it into a hat and still comb it out with my hands afterwards and look fine.  The burts bees stuff doesn't clump hair together, it lets it still bend and flex.
How often do you shampoo your hair? This is my hair after I shampoo it but I only do that once a week maybe.

We don't like things like hygiene and *looking nice* around here, thank you very much.
that's xp waste
Ouch, you got me. 
[deleted]
Sure but what makes this silly is how he's not really doing anything. If he skipped all the messing about and put the hat on immediately he would've looked exactly the same, so the extra preening seems pointless and kinda vain. 
A big portion of us around here prefer not to see ourselves in the mirror, lest we be reminded of our reasons for low self esteem.

Pruning like this would be like putting a silk hat on a pig. Its a waste of time when the odds of another person talking to you are non existant.


This should be at the top but there’s too many haters in this thread 
Really 
And should take off when you're indoors. 
Straight dude here, what an attractive young man. 
I thought he looked like a younger Dexter.
Exactly what I was thinking.
A young Corey Haim was my first thought..
Because he followed rules 1 and 2
I’ve always thought it’s cute to see men look at themselves in the mirror. I was raised in the kind of household where “men were men” and didn’t cry or preen themselves. 

I thoroughly enjoyed this, just about as much as I enjoy watching my husband clearly check out his butt when he is trying on new trousers. 
??? All of the top comments are complimenting him...
Maybe he's just having fun with it. Don't you ever dance around or something while doing everyday type things? Maybe he was singing a song in his head and imagining he was in a musical and the spin around to the final hat placement was the big climax of the song. 
There's a national recall on his lettuce.  It's making folks sick. 
Sickest flo, bro. Ladies love the flo.
Right? I do way cringier shit when I'm on my own getting ready.
you sound like my uncle, who is in jail.
Uh... I’m sure he wouldn’t be creeped out by this comment. /s
it is! i hope he had a nice day

It is more his stance and movements that people are going off. Silly though I agree.
This comment is gay
why im genuinely? Do you mean it was cringey?  I just thought it was a young guy who wants to look his best and i was no different that age in the mirror.
I was hard too
Racists who like to pretend they're not racists made it, and people are "pushing" it to the front page because sometimes racism is funny(see Blazing Saddles for more details). 

Whites are quirky, blacks are quirky, asians too, and not everyone is equal so it's sometime fun to laugh at each others odd habits and traditions.

I'm probably gonna get downvoted anyway by the aforementioned racists, because despite this being a supposed humor page, they don't have a sense of humor about themselves. 
And ?
Just thinking this 💯 
Taco meat for hair sounds inherently racist 
Jesus, relax, _you're on Reddit watching gifs_. Stop acting like a pretentious asshole asking us to "find better things to fill your time", when your post history shows you comment on Reddit literally almost every single day.
He actually plays baseball for UMaryland so yes he is a baseball player 

Source: know of him irl
Nothing lol
Now this might be weird, but not everyone walks around staring at their shoelaces. 
Glad I'm not the only one who noticed that. It's like he's holding his shoulders back, and thrusting his hips forward. 
you should spend less time in front of the mirror
Have you not been outside lately?
1. Thats from his pocket

2. hes like 15 you freak. 
There's a joke somewhere in this comment but I can't quite put my dong on it.
Pretty sure wearing the hat will mess up the hair. 
I was gonna say I think this dude must’ve had long hair before
Catch it in its natural habitat
Yea you gotta make it think its gonna be worn hat-free, then BAM you put your hat on. His hair never knew what was coming.
Funniest comment this morning.
Follicle confusion 
Gotta confuse the hair before you cover it with a hat, right babe?
Well on a serious note after you fix up you're probably going to get on with the rest of your day.  
Just walking outside with a light breeze can change how your hair looks.

I usually do like a half-hearted jumping jack to test how it looks after some movement.
Wait really
I just commented this exact quote 2 mins ago on a completely different thread ina different subreddit that also applied

What's a date? People keep tossing that term around here. 
Absolutely! By why put the hat on that will give you hat head regardless of the preen?
For real. I mean, I loved having long hair from age 16 to around 25. Then it started receding and around age 30 someone showed me a picture of myself -- an overhead shot of me from the back. Hey look, I'm going bald!

Fuck worrying about it, watching it get worse, trying to use some kind of bullshit product to regrow your hair, or even thinking about spending money on hair restoration. Fuck that noise. 

The day I decided to just give the bald look a try was the most freeing day of my life. Yeah, it took everyone a bit to get used to the look but it's so, **so** much better than the "aging 30's guy trying to keep his hairline" look. 

Rock the long hair while you can, but when that shit starts heading south just man up and get rid of it. 
Gonna be part of that life in probably a year or two. My hair in the front keeps thinning and receding and I know one day it's going to reach that tipping point from "Yeah it's thin, but it still looks good" to "You look like a middle-aged history teacher."
Tell that to my head of cow licks.

:(
That's only because your perspective has changed now that you've gone nearly bald. I personally love playing with my hair in front of a mirror, despite being in my 30s. A friend of mine had a hair follicle transplant (not the one with a stripe of skin cut off) and he's gone from quick mirror inspections to long observations and hair flying in all directions.

Saying things like "get on with your life" is ridiculous. We all procrastinate and do things of little meaning from time to time. 
Screw that, my curly hair looks terrible as fuck after I wake up. Nothing wrong with wanting your hair to look nice when you go out, especially if you have some pretty wild looking hair.
Just blowdry it and shove a bit of clay in it tbh, that's what works for me.
> Seriously, if you have that much hair just let it do what it wants and get on with your life.

yeah who cares about personal appearances amirite? don't comb your hair that's wasting your breath.
The straight hair people don't understand -.-
This is *exactly* what I do, having thick wavy hair. This shit works my man. My hair has an incredibly stubborn mind of its own, but if I can work it enough, and put a hat on it for about an hour, maybe more depending if I put in any product or not, this hat manoeuvre will hold it in place how I want it.
Yup, get out of shower, comb while wet into place, pop hat on while still damp, good to go all day
I still do this. My hair is thick and wavy, so I use a little bit of gel, put a stocking hat on and wait a while for my hair to 'set'. Works perfect. 
I used to have trouble with frizzy hair then I found /r/NoPoo. It sounds weird, if you have thick curly hair ripping out all your natural oils with shampoo is not good. Now I use 1:1 vinegar and water every couple of days. No smell and i rarely have a bad hair day. 
Good plan but your hats are probably gross. :P
X20
I do the same. I didn't realize it was a thing.
Same here. Do my hair for work and then wear a hat so the wax dries and hair stays put
I don't want shine at all though. I don't want it to look like I put product into my hair....

If this doesn't shine too much or make my hair "crackly" then I might try it. But I like to put in a stay-in conditioner that helps the hold and it keeps it moisturized (without it looking wet). 
Gay is where you put your penis, not what you wear or how you might take care of yourself.
Lol. To each his own. 
He's just happy to see himself 
He's going on a date so obviously he put something in his pocket to make it look like he has a massive dick. As we all do
Real talk though, this is a serious issue for us dudes who wear slimmer fit jeans.

thank you for your input. we are so grateful

That's not what OCD is
Ya I have OCD and wear the same outfit I wore the day before. What’s your point?
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Next!
Found the scaper
I love you.
is not that the same? You care how you look like because it makes you feel good to know you look good, the only way that makes sense is if other people are watching you or you are walking around mirrors 24/7

That's too bad considering it was an innocent comment. You must have seen something else.
Same
But he's just standing there looking in the mirror?? We all do that lol
Got me
Seriously. Some people don’t understand anything 
It was just maddening because none of the stuff he was doing to his hair was making any difference... and then the added fact that all of it was going to just get covered by a hat and reduced to hat-hair... 
Yikes 
This is a weird racial sub to begin with. Maybe if he was commenting on /r/funny
Boom roasted so hard he deleted the comment.
Ah... well at least I got the baseball part right lol
It seems like he keeps his shoulders back, but has a large anterior pelvic tilt. If had to guess, it’s because of hockey. But otherwise his upper body is proper posture. 
more yawn, just a bad comment lol
Even more yawn. Tremendously bad comment. SAD!
I have the best hats.
What 
#I HAVE THE BEST HATS.
It’s a joke big guy R E L A X
It's a dong scratcher for sure.
Just don’t put your dong on the child 
Just let it hang, my man
But if you know or even think the hat will come off later, there's nothing wrong with spending a few minutes to make sure its doesn't turn into cow licked bed hair.
Not that much if you wear it a certain way and fix your hair beforehand, like he’s doing
Nah, I do it a lot as well. Not as much as he's doing, but if I was to literally just dry off my hair and put a hat on, it'll be way worse than if I took the time to at least like run my hands through it and sort of part it to the side or slick it back.

April/21/2018 
July 4, 1776.  December 7, 1941.  July 20, 1969.  I date a lot!

^^^^^^^.

^^^I ^^^just ^^^like ^^^history. ^^^:(
Maybe amping himself up or admiring himself? I have a buzz cut but I still put some Moroccan oil on my stubble because it makes me feel pretty/smell nice even though it's kinda pointless.  
It's better to go Picard than Castanza. 
Also head of cowlicks here, just gotta learn to embrace it. Find a style that works for you, either long or very short, no medium hair. Always use a blow dryer. And while I'm finally able to go without, a little well used product goes a long way. 
[Wild, untidy hair](http://media.vogue.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/haircocktails-featured1-troy-moth.jpg) is a style that many people like. They would pay a stylist lots of money to create a look like your head of cow licks.
100% in your corner. I have big thick curls that sprout everywhere. Gotta put in the time to look presentable. 
Hah, I'm reading this as I start my 1 hour curls routine for the morning. 
Pretty wild looking hair is great. You don't want to look like a rock star?
That wasn't what I said at all. The guy in this video is wasting time and energy, he's fussing over his hair in a way that make zero actual difference. Wash it, make sure its the right length, even use a bit of product or colour it if you want a specific look. Just stop making a big deal about things that are insignificant.
Oh I beg to differ. My hair is wires. Whatever position it dries in it stays in in a straight direction so I look like alfalfa. I do the hat thing because it dries in place
You should see my underwear.
Haha, I’m glad someone else can relate. I feel alone out here with my daily struggles. 
I'm in the same boat. If that had a matte look with the high control I'd get it. Maybe there's a variant for us matte people.
Do you know what a joke is? Or do you think homosexuals are weaker than you so they need your protection and special treatment? Geez with that attitude no wonder comedians are getting fined for jokes. I have fucking fabulous long curly hair myself
Is it solipsistic in here, or is it just me?
Do guys really do that?
Jeez, you're quick to get your panties up in a twist.
You’re welcome.
Cause it's irrelevant to the discussion, but seriously I hope you guys get into therapy cause having trouble making decisions can be a sign of anxiety
It is. The inability to make decisions is a symptom of OCD. 
I guess unlike me, you do not constantly fear that by wearing a certain shirt or article of clothing that you could cause something terrible to happen that will result in the deaths of innocent people or loved ones. 
This triggers me

I love you both
If someone didn't know what Rules 1 and 2 by now, I'd be shocked. It's probably the most repeated comment on Reddit.
My uncle gave the best BJs this side of the Mississippi. How dare you tarnish his name.
Too many adjectives. Too much adoration for stranger. 
The way he puts out his chin and angles his neck near the end and even they way he has his hands at the end to turn off the light switch. Look I'm not saying it is true just like those are the signs I'd read from it if someone asked. I'm surprised you can't look deeper than just seeing someone standing in front of a mirror.
Some people on here have never tried to look nice before. 
Ahh. The old anterior pelvic tilt excuse. 

If I had a nickel...
Almost like it’s right on the tip of my dong...
Habihat
I'd tap that.
I recently saw this explained recently in a VSauce episode. You say faster than light speed, but doesn't it 'only' need to be close to the speed of light?
The sheer amount of sexual preference subgenres is astounding 
Careful with that link
should probably tag NSFW.
The Browns?
HEY ASSMAN!!!
Can I also put my seed inside??

Fun fact: the genus is Phoenix cuz it's the tree that the mythical bird would build its nest in and burst into flame in the morning sun, to be reborn from the ashes. 

And the species name dactylifera means "finger bearer" since the fruits look like fingers before they're dried. 
>finally able to go without


What is this madness?
That only works if you're already attractive.
Yea that's like mine, but im a dude lol. Never as nicely styled though. My hair is really thick and wavy/curly. So I can't shape it how I want it without cowlicks, but when my hair is buzzed, or I have a fade I look like I just came from a Hitler youth camp
I’m 36. Each year my hair get thinker and curlier. I can’t explain it but it does. The amount of time I have to put in to taming it and making myself look presentable is outrageous. 

People always say how great my hair is and how lucky I am. If they only knew my agony...
You need hair wax, dude. Work it in, let it dry, comb it out.

What's left will actually make it possible to shape your hair.
I wax my pubes too but that is for a different thread. 
Guy hair problems. It's the wild wild west baby and I am unarmed
It chaps me when people with thick glorious hair complain about having thick glorious hair
No facial expressions, no emoji, no /s - nothing from a delivery perspective so couldn’t tell. Didn’t mean to lecture anyone Sat morning ... have a great day.
Of course. 10 inch dildo to match the magnum condoms that we  accidently drop from our wallet
Irrelevant to the discussion? Wtf it was an on-topic response to the original comment.
>I wonder how long it took him to pick out that t shirt and jeans he has on

 The fact that they mentioned OCD was adding to the conversation, not diverting it. 

And get the fuck out of here with your "advice." If they have OCD then they don't need your goofy ass telling them to seek therapy. 

 
How is the ocd comment irrelevant but a comment making fun of a typo saying dong instead of doing...completely relevant. 
He literally said "I have OCD". I don't think they're too worried about signs of anxiety assuming it wasn't just a figure of speech.
Thanks. I’ve been receiving CBT treatment from a psychologist for the past two years. 
Ok doc
Just because you are indecisive that doesn't mean you are OCD. People tend to claim the disorder without being diagnosed way too often.

I have only been here about a year. This is first time I've heard it. And now I know.
I think I know your Uncle.  We're almost family.
It's called a complete sentence with just the right amount of both.  This is how you express an observation. Don't be afraid of words.
My point is people can do things that are "seemingly" one thing, but not be that one thing. Ive met many men that, based on certain characteristics and mannerisms, I've thought were gay. As it turns out, they aren't. I've also met men that exhibit all the so-called qualities of a straight men, and they're gay. 

I'm just saying like this man isn't bangin it out with another dude, nor is he explicitly saying that he is gay, so we have no information to base that assumption on and it's really none of our business anyway.
It's the poor returns for me. Dude takes a minute (that we see) to effect his appearance by maybe .0001%. Which just makes me anxious for the dude because how do you live life sweating over that ten-thousandth of a percent?
Am slow, what do you mean? Is there some conspiracy against the anterior pelvic tilt? 
i almost have it but i just cant ejaculate it out

Honestly don’t know, I’m sure whatever VSauce said is right though 
You're not wrong, but this specific example is based on a meme.
Yes
Welcome to the internet
Like, 26000 members astounding
The Packers?
You have to get the date first, champ.
Just found the right style, blow dry and condition a lot, and have trained it the same way for years and years hahah.
He just needs a hat, dude. 
Yeah that isn't me. Definitely thin wiry hair. If I condition it with some good stuff it becomes silky smooth and holds no shape at all which gives me the water buffalo look. 
it is something though lol, 30 minutes to toss on a shirt and pants. Has to be some sort of phobia. 
Well he did say dong so...
Reddit used to be fun
I was diagnosed when I was 12. I am currently 25. I’ve gone through therapy four times. I’ve been with my current psychologist for two years. I know what living with OCD is like. 
My comment wasn't supposed to be derision, more of a hyperbole about how often it seems to pop up. 
[Congrats your one of today's 10,000 (which I assume you are also one of today's 10,000 for seeing this comic  too...)](https://xkcd.com/1053/)
Nope and they told me to avoid strangers giving me compliments on my appearance 
>Look I'm not saying it is true just like those are the signs I'd read from it if someone asked.

So you agree. 

I don't know why people want to guess his sexuality but we are on the internet who gives a shit. They are just guessing he is gay and most of the comments don't hate on him for it and seem to more be creeping on him. In the end I'm sure the guy won't care.
You’ve aroused my interest now
I remember when I first read the original Sherlock Holmes and the word "ejaculate" came up. Had a little laugh and kept reading, then told my brother. So very much like Reddit.
Which is only more amazing. There's already shit loads of legitimate kink subs and then there's an active one (probably not the only one) that started from a meme....
I feel like wanting to see a goth girl with big titties naked is not really that odd.
When he gets older, he's traded to the Bears
A coconut is an acceptable substitute tho
I'm not your dude, bro.
True you don't see the word dong too often unless you are on a shitty sex toy site. 
I've been on redit off and on..for a few years...mostly it's just sad lonely people lashing out to feel like they have some control in their lives :/. I like when I can actually talk to someone and get a laugh or 2. 
That's too bad that your were taught such a ridiculous thing.  A simple and clearly innocent compliment doesn't warrant such a response.  There was nothing sexual or nefarious by my comment except what you internalized. 
I love to kiss tittiess
I'm not your bro, pal.
I never brought sexuality into it? Guilty conscience?
I'm not your pal, man. 
I'm not your pal, fella.
I believe you are what they call a "troll?"  

I'm not your man, friend.
And now you have to pay the troll toll
