Setting the priorities straight.

The thing is, they are already in the game
Afair it's already in the game, along with the ... toe.

What pubg needs is dong physics, to avoid being called sexist game.
I thought it says "Add good physics" first, but it's even better ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I wish to have in this game what H1 has.
Ability to see my ping+net graph to see any packet loss etc and also ping of my opponent.
Maybe in 2k19 or later but I still hope to see this in pubg.

Feelsbadman. Nothing hurts more than the robbery of ur meymey


EDIT: I'm glad mah mimi got noticed even if I'm not the guy in the post.
People asked for this in GTA V (not in NPC’s, in online characters since it was already on NPC’s) it was pretty funny.
You should see the comments on the mobile version. There seems to be a pretty strong following for adding 'wild animals'. 
Dick dynamics desperately desired 
I mean, VR Chat has boob physics now.  Why is this not a thing yet??
More. 👏 Bounce. 👏

Remember the camel toe that got removed? That shit was hilarious.
Really? My brother plays a female character and I've never noticed them jiggle at all.

Maybe they just need to be bigger.

Truly Conan Exiles was a game ahead of its time. Dong physics AND size sliders
We all know they can’t do that.
I wish I was high on potnues 
Someone is hurt
Sounds stupid af though. Do you really want a deer running around the final zone. Game already has enough optimization issues. More moving parts isn’t going to go well.
I DEMAND PROOF!

ADD 

BOOB SIZE

OPTION
If you look closely while teabagging, the boobs are tied to the weapon physics
Add a Saints Row-style sex appeal slider
Take inspiration from lara crofts first game.
they are, try moving while prone
Let's be real it's was all or nothing with those sliders, might has well have been a switch between no penis and biggest penis. 
HAHA I WISH I WAS HIGH ON POTNUES
>Someone is hurt

That's the joke...

Truly hurts. I'll be stepping off the internet for a while. Can't handle this.
Imagine being in the final circle, 2 players remaining, last guy dies by a snake bite.

Would be priceless.

The models are licensed from 3rd party modellers, not PUBG's own
Man of culture
Boob sliders
Out of context, this sentence would be super weird. 
When they said looking at porn could cause you to go blind, they probably were talking about Lara's traingular titties from TR1.
Are they physics or part of the crawling animation. There's a huge difference. 
*h-hey man not cool*
/s next time, saves a ton of karma i learned.
Whoops, looks like Jim accidentally coded in a vagina again
lmao that's fucking great 
Wonder what PUBG devs think of RUST
"Were an accident"
I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder. I see a penis and a pair of testicles. Perhaps a transgender woman who doesn't tuck well.
Hawt
Can we also get ass size options? 
/r/nocontext
I could see those poking an eye out.
When you're driving in FPP and look at your teammates while turning you see them jiggle a bit.

Fair point. A joke almost always has an over-reaction - that's the point. Should be quite obvious that I don't really mean it.

And a dick sized option. I want people to know they are facing an enraged tiny dicked gremlin!
Its only fair that we get to copy something from Fortnite
We Conan the game now
Agreed. I wanna teabag someone so hard they are killed twice by suffocation
