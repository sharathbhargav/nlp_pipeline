Have you ever heard the story of darth plagueis the wise?
If I remember correctly, the original post was the guy was watching his parents house while they were out of town and the dog wasn't warming up to the him.
I don't see no dogs? Is this r/lostredditors material?

Doggo has wares if you have treats. 
You can always tell a Milford man
I think he has a new mission for you 
May the force be with you young padawan
“That man in the corner, who is he?”

“He’s one of them Rangers. Dangerous folk, they are, wandering the wilds. What his right name is I’ve never heard, but round here he’s known as Strider.”
You were suppose to destroy the Sith, not join them! 
Excellent TV show choice! 
Am I the only one that thought klansman?
I thought this was r/dundermifflin

This was my favorite scene in the first Jurassic park.

How is a prequel meme the top comment when that dog is clearly giving the Jim eh face...hell you could've gone with a Dwight as the emperor line...you definitely didn't have the high ground.
*Ryan, you have a WUPHF on line 1...*

It’s not a tale the Jedi would tell
As much as that is what came to my head too, on repeated viewings, the covering one eye is more of a [anakin](https://i.imgur.com/dAEOdQK.png) thing to do.
Playguys the wise
GODS
I get home from work so tired that I don’t feel like watching anything where I have to pay too much attention. The office is perfect for that 
Part of me wants people in the office to have learned their lesson and just shut the hell up. But part of me thinks, you know what? Keep talking. I'd really love a home theater.
i really like how i can watch the office without watching the screen but still know whats going on just by what i hear. makes it nice to lie down and watch
me too thanks
It’s the episode when Oscar comes back after his “sabbatical” because Michael kissed him.

The one where Oscar comes back after his leave because Michael kissed him. In the gif he's saying ".... I'd really like a home theatre" 
that’s not an episode, it’s a dog

Iconic.

My karma level literally gives me the high ground in the comments 
Not a tail the Jedi would wag
GOODBOYS ON AN OPEN FIELD NED
I’ve watched always sunny a couple times already where I actually paid attention. But I just like getting stoned and letting it run because the few times I’ll punch into actually seeing it I won’t need to know what happened the scene or two before to understand what’s going on. 
Wtf even is this
People like you make the world a better place.

Your karma level gives you the attic and too many chicken wings ground.

*edit*
Didn't have to look passed your 2nd to last post...you definitely have the low ground.
GODS I WAS A GOOD BOY BACK THEN
It's a bot that keeps track of what that guy says. And labels them like a Bible verse.

Except it's the furthest you can stray from God's light because those book names are always named after furry porn artists.
YOUR DOGGO WHAT A GOODBOY WITH A CUTE NAME
