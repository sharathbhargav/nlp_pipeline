TIFU By walking in on my mom masturbating...
As per the usual of this subreddit, this happened about 3 years ago. So some things you may want to know before is I was 16 at the time, and my parents are die-hard, anti-masturbation Christians, and my dad was always travelling for work and I had after-school activities, so my mom had a lot of down time.

So back in high school I played a lot of video games and always kept my doors closed, because I enjoy my privacy. My mom was always SUPER suspicious about my door being closed and what I was doing, so she would bust open trying to "catch me in the act". 

So after my wrestling coach got in altercation with another teacher, practice was cancelled for the day and I got home a lot earlier than I usually do. Also my dad was out of town, and my younger brother got out of school a lot later in the day than I did, so it was basically the perfect storm.With no lifting or wrestling practice, I was in a super good mood, so I thought I would play a prank on my mom. I was always really annoyed when she would bust my door open, scaring me half to death, so I figured it would be a good idea to do the same to her.

When I got home the house was eerily quiet, which was odd because usually my mom was watching TV or cleaning the house. So I slowly and quietly walked upstairs to my parents room. When I got there I could hear her breathing heavily which was SOOO weird, but nevertheless I still thought It would be funny to scare her. So I busted the door open as loud as possible and yelled "WHAT ARE YOU DOING!", only to see her with an obvious face of pleasure with her hand down her pants. then she SOARED off the bed like an Olympic high jumper an then crouched behind the bed, SCREECHING at me to get out. 

So I ran to my room and starting freaking out hard, kicking myself for being so stupid. About 15 minutes passed of sheer anxiety and worry, my mother quietly enters my room and tells me that she was taking a nap and I scared her, and that she was very angry and disappointed that I would do such a thing.

 I was too petrified to tell her that I knew what she was really doing, so I played along in hopes that it would save myself from the awkwardness in times to come. I was then grounded for two months from my computer and phone. But from then on, she ALWAYS knocked before entering my room, so mission accomplished I think?

TL;DR. I busted in on my ultra-christian mom masturbating and she got super pissed off, grounded me for two months, and tried to play it off as a nap...

EDIT: Since some people want detail about my wrestling coach’s altercation it’s not that interesting. The former wrestling coach was fired for fighting a parent after one of our meets. The new coach is an older guy with lots of experience and really nice, unlike my old coach. My old coach had some words to say about the new coach, so the old coach went to my new coaches classroom and started trying to instigate a fight DURING CLASS. My wrestling coach said if he wanted to fight it would be after school far away. The fight never happened and my old coach was fired from his teaching job and my new coach was put on paid leave for 2 weeks. That’s it. Happy?
At least she learned her lesson and quit barging I’m on you
You should have asked if you were prohibited from ‘taking naps’ too.
Wow the grounding was unnecessary 
Lol seems like parents punishments are always worse when you do something slightly wrong that exposes them doing something they'd crucify you for
Maybe it's because I'm not a parent, but it seems weird that your mom is trying to catch you in the act. 
Thankfully you didn't jump in while asking "need a hand with anything?" 
So your mom grounded you for two months for walking in on her taking a nap? The official story at least?
Your mother can go fuck herself.
Is no one else interested in the part where his wrestling coach fought another teacher?? I wanna hear that story.
so, did you lose any respect for her after that?

not for masturbating - but for lying about it and punishing you for no reason
Did she still use the word napping after that?
Wow she geounded you for catching her being a massive hypocrite!?!   Jeez that's shameful
"... and that's the story of how my mom went blind." 
Classic projection. "Masturbating is horrible and I suspect you're always doing it in your room.... because I am always doing it in my room and I feel tons of self guilt about it."

Edit: thanks for reminding me autocorrect sucks
Well, the grounding was unfair, but do you consider it worth it now that she knocks?
Sucks that she grounded you though...
At least you didn't walk in on your son with his face in his girlfriends ass getting farted on
I would bring it up at thanksgiving this year
Poor Lady is more than likely sexually repressed. Grew up being told she would go to hell for this and this and cant even masturbate. Fuck that life style.
"I don't think I'm grounded mom. I think MY privacy will be protected from now on, or dad will hear about your efforts to make Jesus sad."
This is a really shitty, unhealthy manipulative thing for a woman to do to a young man, being her biological son be damned.

 I hope you call her out on it one day
Maybe if you break both arms she’ll change her mind 
Your mom  hypocrite 
2 fucking months? what kind of mom is that
As a Christian, I always find it weird how prideful Christians can be and not come clean when we know we do something wrong or even get caught, but have trouble admitting it considering how the Bible reminds us to be humble, confess, and repent. Instead, we have communities where people are shunned or shamed  based on appearance and actions when those are the people who should be reached out to. Unfortunately, a lot of church communities act similarly to the Pharisees described in the Gospel putting on a good face with others, but hiding sinful desires/actions from others for the sake of their own reputation.
She grounded you for not lending a hand...
You fucked up not by walking in on you mom mastrubating, you fucked up by playing along to her "napping"
Dude, what.  My normal, non Christian father used to do this same thing.  I was a nerd loser girl with no friends, so I know he never suspected anything.  But it'd be playing video games and he'd barge open the door and yell, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING".  He was just joking though, and it'd always scare the crap out of me!

Bonus:  He also used to walk up to me, point, and say "IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT."  :C  I told my best friend about this, and now she'll randomly tell me, "Your dad was right!"

Parents are crazy.
You should bring it up now as an adult. At Christmas. Over dinner. 
Pictures of mom?
Maybe you could get her a gift certificate to one of those stores that sells devices for "napping".  You know, to bury the hatchet.
If you had a spine, it would have been her who was grounded for two months...

Wait, no, you still have the upper hand...

Any awkward moment you want a new TIFU, "Hey mom, remember how you used to burst into my room all the time until you grounded me for two months because I burst in on you masturbating?"
How would you describe your mother if you have to compare her to a celebrity?
Every time you got caught jerking off, you could have told her you were just talking a nap, and she spooked a boner into your hand.
Is your name Butters?
How do you get grounded? Like does she chain you to the wall?
Why on Earth would a Mom want to catch their son "in the act"?  If any Mom's read this comment, do not desire to "catch your son in the act"... everyone masturbates, it's healthy, it's normal.  What isn't normal is wanting to catch your son doing it.
Is she hot?
Napping or Fapping? 
Did you smash?
"You did to me what I always do to you, and that's not okay. I was having a 'nap', so you are grounded for 2 months"

-Parent logic
>So I ran to my room and starting ~~freaking out~~ jerking off hard


Why the hell were you grounded?
How did you pull off walking and masturbating at the same time?
Finally, a believable "tifu"
Good job OP. You got your mom to stop barging in every few hours. Was it worth it?
[removed]
And this is going to be on pornhub. 
"I know what I saw! I'm telling Dad!"
LOL
As a dude who grew up in a christian home as well, i find this extra funny bro. Also, good for you with lifting and sports practice dude. Makes for a healthy lifestyle. 
>  she would bust open trying to "catch me in the act".

I immediately knew the pro revenge that was coming for mom...although it was kinda like...Pyrrhic pro revenge lol

> Only to see her with an obvious face of pleasure with her hand down her pants.

And on that day...OP received a grim reminder.
To add salt to the wound, you SHOULD have later said "wash your fuckin hands, I want a sandwich"
You should have told your dad what you were actually grounded for.
this thread requires pics of your mother
That's some serious ammunition you got there for the future buddy.
I almost didnt read this.
Um your mom is kind of an asshole for giving you that punishment 
> So back in high school I played a lot of video games and always kept my doors closed, because I enjoy my privacy. My mom was always SUPER suspicious about my door being closed and what I was doing, so she would bust open trying to "catch me in the act".

The alternate method would be to continue jerking off while looking into her eyes when she walked in on you.  That might have gotten you grounded three months but it would have been so much creepier. 
The anti-masturbation thing takes religion to a whole 'nuther level of stupidity. 

If god/mother nature/the vacuum of space, didn't want you to masterbate, why put your genitals within arms reach?
Yea you didn’t fuck up. You showed her how ridiculous her actions were. If there’s one thing Christians hate its being caught as a hypocrite 
Your parents sound like real winners
It's so fascinating to me how you can almost immediately identify what people do that they are ashamed of by how hard they rail against something.

Super anti-abortion? You probably had one in high school or college.

Super anti-gay? You probably either fantasize about having or have had homosexual encounters.

Super anti-whatever? You probably want to or are already doing that thing.
Its almost hard to imagine justice so succinct. I admire your character, your moms dishonest but you should let her know we all think about Jon Hamm in our lonelier moments.
Alternate Story: 

I was getting on really well with this older lady online, she was American, and brought up in a strict household but her husband was always out of town so we'd regularly have phone sex. She was utter filth, but one day during our intimate session whilst she was shaking hands with madame growler on the webcam for me, one of her kids comes bursting in and she has to shout at him to get out. 

Completely ruined my afternoon hand shandy. Later she told me she grounded him for two months to make sure we were never disturbed again. 
Does any one else wanna know about the altercation with the wresting coach and the other teacher?
My mom was the exact same way haha Luckily I never walked in on her but she would have used the exact same tactics of deny, blame, punish, never discuss again
2 month grounding? That's way overboard IMO. 
Hypocritical Christians? I am shocked.
It's good that she quit barging into your room, but fuck me if my parents had confiscated my computer when I was a kid for two whole months I would have gone crazy
>I was too petrified to tell her that I knew what she was really doing, so I played along in hopes that it would save myself from the awkwardness in times to come.

[Made me instantly think of this.](https://youtu.be/zVXSC4nszJg?t=14s)
That's the religious way, punish others for your own skeletons in the closet. 
How do you not blackmail her when she tries to ground you for 2 months?  Better yet what kind of rational human being takes out their incredible self guilt on others?  Like she would have grounded you or been “extremely disappointed” if you’d just woken her up for a nap.  Her dumb ass just made her even more suspicious.

Is she hot?
Damn your mom sounds like she a massive stick up her ass.
Perfect christian values. "Do as I say, not as I do." 
The fuck is wrong with some parents?

I put privacy locks on my kids' bedrooms.  There's no way I would want to catch them when they're trying to have some private time. 
But did you smash? 
you should have blackmailed her
Shouldve told your dad in the hopes of him being more faithfull than her
Gross. My sympathies, nobody deserves to see that.
Idle hands are your mother's playthings
Yo, she grounded you for catching her in her hypocrisy?!?!? I feel so much like an agnsty teenager again just at the damn thought of this!! 
Ignore the grounding, if she tries to call you out on it tell her you'll tell people what you saw.
**WHAT THE FRICK! IWAS TAKINGA NAP!**
Like most “ultra Christians”, your mom is a fucking hypocrite.
Don't cut yourself on that edge. 
I used to use my mom's laptop to look up porn when I was young and didn't know how history works, or pop ups. So she is at church or work and I used t he laptop, a few hours later she calls me into her room and sits me down. Asks me what I was using the laptop for and tells me not to use the laptop for evil while there is a topless Asian on a pop up in the back ground.
This very much reminds me of the hypocrisy behind the ultra anti-homosexual pastors. -The type that are always going out of their way to preach about the sins of others and who inevitably end up getting caught in a compromising situation. 

Basically OPs mom probably did this daily, held in self loathing and repented by "saving," OP. 

People are so screwy. 
>not offering to help her and losing your virginity

Die Hard: Anti-Masturbation Christians

IN THEATRES NOW
You join in or what?  Let’s go
Am I the only guy who is curious what his mom looks like and how old she was at the time?
Good thing your arms didn't break during that hectic situation
If you are older now, reapproach her with this. Let's see what she says. 
I’m sorry but your mom’s a hypocrite
Your mom sucks.
You could used that information against her and that could've convinced her to not ground you.
What a hypocritical bitch
Ahhhh. Hypocritical turbo Christian parents. Trying to hold the world back with their "values", while being an exception to the rule. 

Fact: 99% of women masterbate. The other 1% don’t have arms. 
Is your mom hot? 
Pic of your mom possible?
Agreed. For science. 
you got grounded! and she lied about it! christians suck
these "Christian" parents are really something
Must have been one hell of a dream!
"Grrr you caught me in the middle of my hipocracy. Now I'm gonna punish *you* even though **I** was the one in the wrong!"

Christians, acting exactly like their churches.

*Ironic.Senator*
Why are evangelical Christians (and other conservative religions) so weird sometimes? She wanted to catch you masturbating???? That’s verryyyyy strange to me. Like borderline sexually abusive  tbh 
I doubt she wanted to catch him. Its more the idea that she or OP’s dad could come in at any moment, so its too risky to even try.

The looming threat is a move my parents would pull on things other than masturbating, and they werent even very religious
I don’t know. Not giving your children, who are that age, simple privacy and making them fear masturbating is just abusive. I guess everyone has their own opinions but that’s a horrific abuse of power in my opinion. 
This just proves that Christian parents aren't only idiots they think their kids are idiots too which enforces that they are idiots because they don't have the capacity to even believe you would think she was doing something else. 
Pics of your mom please. If you can get some of her nude, that would be better.
The title of this should be “TIL Christians are hypocrites just like everyone else.”
Speak friend and enter
Melons ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I like it wiggling and raw
Payback
This is just so sad on so many levels.
Sounds like a Pyrrhic victory

Taking a nap? If she told you she was practicing the mixtables that would seem more plausible. 
Damn, you scared the Jesus out of her, just before he managed to call in God.
🎵 Keep your rifle by your side 🎶
That buzzing noise wasn’t the dryer. 
I would have offered to help her finish, but my family was different.
Name checks out.
Did she break your arms after? 
Oh how the tables have turned
I’ve gone through a similar experience.  My family hardly knocks on the door except me which is super annoying . But mine on the other hand was that my mom and dad was wrestling in bed and I was 14 at the time so I  thought I annoy them like how they do to me. I bathed into the room only to  hear them going off and lucky for me my dad pulled the comforter for cover. Let’s just say from that day, my parents would always knock at least twice before entering my room 
Flicking the bean
Why would she want to catch you masturbating?
What an hypocrite she is. Shes a very disrespectful person from what I can understand.
Usually if your parents are super paranoid about you doing something, it's because they've done it too.
 True or not, that's a scene you can't unsee.
Yeah, but is she hot? 
Tough luck, Butters
TIFU? Dude, that was a victory, though that grounding part was a bummer.
“Taking a nap” 
Proof that some of us do it, the rest lie about it
You should have told her that you'd tell Dad if she grounded you
Grossssssssss!
> my mom had a lot of down time

That's one way to put it
The grounding was very unnecessary. but hey, at least if she always knocks first now, you can whack your days away!
Don't feel bad.  Pornhub has shown many instances of this happening.  Definitely more common than you think.
Shoulda pulled your dick out and fucked her bro 
Congrats on getting your privacy back!
Honey I was just fapping, err I mean napping. You're grounded.
Ironic.
Something something broken arms
throwaway bc this is a tad embarrassing but I had a similar experience.

Parents did the same thing to me, multiple times and shouted/called me names bc of it.

Now I have a humiliation kink that it makes it hard to get aroused in bed without being humiliated, I ran it by a psyche that I was seeing at the time (for something unrelated) and she said it was more than likely because of what happened when I was younger.

Thanks mum
Pretty sure I’ve seen this porno
Did you bring it up later?  That definitely would have been solid gold knowledge for blackmail. 

“Mom I definitely think you want to change your no to a yes. Or perhaps me and DAD should have a talk about your alone activities at the house. You know what? Now I’d like 2 pairs, just so I’m sure we have an understanding. You can pray on it but don’t take too long. “
So are we in agreement that OPs parents made bad parenting decisions?     
    
I get wanting to know what your kids are doing but people masturbate *(clearly OPs mom knows this)*. Teenagers especially. So to be hawking for that is just wrong. I would understand if it were drugs or sneaking out. If a girl was over door open, sure makes sense. Bursting in with hope that your son is rubbing one out and you can catch him is just wrong.     
     
But the grounding your son for 2 months because you think masturbating is a sin and have ridculous standaeds against it and he caught **you** doing it is bad parenting. You punished your son because you couldnt resist masturbating. Like what? You raise a kid that bursting into a room is acceptable behavior to catch him jerking off and you get caught doing the same so you punish him for your embarassment.      
      
If I were OP and I got grounded for that I would've told her like it was. I wouldve called out her "nap" and how it's fucked up I am punished for you not controlling yourself. The fuck.
At least your arms weren't broken
I’d like to know more about the coach’s altercation. Did he put the other teacher in the full Nelson? 
Any pics of your mom? She hot? 
Kid sees mom
Getting rocks off
And in turn
Turns the knocks off
I woulda called her ass out after the grounding. That’s not cool.
Everybody does it and people who proclaim they don't are simply lying, or into something far darker or kinkier which they rigorously will deny.
Fucked up parents man. Nothing personal, but i don't even know where to start.

Give your kid some personal space and respect. And you were grounded?! 

The fuck? I hope this story isn't real
Nah, I know a lot of people who grew up in environments like that 
Lmao I don’t think there’s many things in this world I fucking hate more than extreme Christians.
Do your parents introduce themselves as "Anti\-masturbation Christians" or is it just for context?
Once I walked in to the toilet while my grandmother was about urinate. She was almost on seat. Imagine that.
Nice what does she look like
why no video camera? ...God damn it...the first rule of busting in on anti\-masturbatory Christian moms masturbating is to have a camera....you are a failure! 
How do you kick yourself 
This reminds me of butters from south park. You're GRRRRRRROUNDED
> and my parents are die-hard, anti-masturbation Christians

Well that explains everything. 
Is she at least hot?
I'm here for the broken arm jokes. Don't let me down, Reddit.
Like Joe Rogan says, 'There is a reason your arm is exactly THAT long."
JESUS IS WATCHING IT ALL
I can't keep reading the word "busting" in sentences about your mom! Ahh
Stopped reading at ‘my mom always tried to catch me in the act’

What the hell?
>she would bust open trying to "catch me in the act

wtf?  
IMO this is a legit form of abuse and people need to recognize that, no matter how Christian they feel the need to be.
Did she break both your arms??
Grounded for that? Is your name Butters? 
Usually if someone is fearful that someone else is going to do something, it's because that someone is guilty of doing it themselves.

For example, my mom always was always suspicious of me stealing money from her wallet when I was a teenager, years later I found out she was a petty thief.
Yikes. 
Maybe if you had "gently opened the door" it could've been much worse. r/DDLC 
What a nightmare scenario
If text posts could trend on r/nonono this’d be grade A material.
I just want to say that I saw the title of this post and decided I am definitely not reading it 
Something something two broken arms. 
Dis gud boi
You got grounded for 2 months for that..? Your parents are trash lmao
Hahahahaha that's just way awesome after I heard she pulls that shit on you!😂
I know where this is going 

Edit: Oh.. That's it? 
TL:DR

But your mom masturbating sounds pretty hot 🤣 
That is some bullshit if I’ve ever heard it. 
She was angry and disappointed that you would do such a thing? You mean the exact same thing that she does? She essentially taught you that it’s ok to bust into people rooms unannounced because why would she be masturbating if it’s bad and god doesn’t like it , right? Then the first time you do it you catch her wet handed and she is not only embarrassed/scared but she knew that if she admitted it like an adult that she would look like a crazy hypocrite and also have to admit that masturbation is ok. So what does she do? She grounds you because she made herself look like an asshole. Man parents egos are fragile.
This subreddit should be renamed as Three Years Ago I Fucked Up. TYAIFU
At least you didn't broke the two arms. No release in that kind of family
This reminds me of something that would happen to Butters from South Park 
Taught her a lesson. 
Missions accomplished! It only cost you a horrific image that you'll carry for the rest of your life :D
Listen, you are a paragon of patience since you did not do any revenge for grounding you. 
Dude, christian parents = extremely rough childhood. I feel you.
So you wanted to play the same prank on her but she was usually watching TV or cleaning the house?  Why would you think of that prank knowing that she's usually not behind a closed door?


How’s therapy going?
Yikes, I have a lot of resentment towards your mom just by reading that
Like I'm curious if this is the normal super Christian mom's I know, or a super hot Christian mom that is almost non-existent.....
Seriously...? she grounded you for TWO MONTHS? If thats not an overreaction then i don't know what is...
Honestly, just the title is enough of a TIFU lol
How do you keep a young person from masturbating? I mean, 3 years old keep touch their penis, imagine a 13 year old.
Grounded for that? WHAT?
Pics or it didn’t happen
Wow, your mom is, or was a total hypocrite. 
Similar story:

https://youtu.be/Ml79j4zNVcE
And people say you can’t fire teachers.
Pretty shitty of her to ground you for 2 MONTHS over that. Seems a bit overkill
Definitely deserved for her. Still it would really be awkward for me all life I think.
I fucking hate humans 
Hold up. Why did you get grounded?! 
What weight class did you wrestle at?
Grounded for two months because you busted ur mom jilling. Damn, you didn’t even do anything wrong. Plus its weird shes so concerned what ur doing in your room alone with the door closed. Its normal to knock and check but if ur a normal kid making mostly good decisions, weird thst shes suspicious. At least you caught what she was probably suspicious about. Overly religious people are nuts. I go to church and I see it in my own church, feel bad for the children.
This is the greatest role reversal since the dog walked in on my Dad licking his own ass.
Wow seriously? Grounded for doing to her once what she’s constantly doing to you? A) she wouldn’t have even grounded you if she wasn’t masturbating so it’s obviously not even your fault and b) she’s constantly barging in on you. Maybe she should learn to respect other people’s privacy.
You’re glorious. 
I will never get being against masturbation
> so she would bust open trying to "catch me in the act"

I will never understand why parents do this. I'm a grown ass man, but I was staying with my family for christmas. It was about 3 AM, and I was watching some video game youtube videos. My mom opens the door quietly and hands me a glass of water. 

So let me get this straight. It was 3 AM, you knew I was using a computer from the glow, and you decide to sneak in anyway? How badly do you want to see your son jacking it? 


It's the Christian way to condemn the whole world for doing something, do it themselves, and punish the innocent for their own proclivities. What a fucking joke.
That's what your mom gets for trying to catch you.

What was she gonna do when she caught you: make a porno and help you?

I dont understand why anyone cares if their children are doing that. You KNOW what they are doing, its fucking nature.

Always knock. I have 2 and I never wanna catch them, there is no need.

I'll always knock.
This would make a great Seinfeld episode! The contest part 2?
super weird that a mom would actively try to catch you givin it to yourself
Title sounded like you were walking around the house jerking off and barging into people's rooms  lol
This sounds like a mother and son beggining video
Sometimes you have to lose a battle to win a war.
I’ll be in my room taking a nap for approximately 30 to 45 minutes. 
You were grounded for 2 months as an outlet for her shame :(
Typical hypocritical Christian parent
>so she would bust open trying to "catch me in the act".

WHAT? Who would try to catch their kid tugging one out? When I have kids and that door is shut, I'm going to loudly approach it, make a lot of noise, then knock, and wait till I get the all clear.
Do people just not have locks on their doors?
3 years later and youre still thinking about your mom masturbating. Oedipal complex
This post really angered me. I know people just like your parents and the feeling of never being trusted especially at such an older age is pretty heartbreaking. Their kids left home just as they turned 18 and have refrained from having contact with them. I do hope your situation isn't as bad as I'm thinking. Good luck bro.
I'm not sure I agree that the wrestling story isn't interesting....
Jesus what a terribly selfish reaction for a mother to have.
If only they invented some sort of mechanism to put on a door so people on the other side couldn’t open it.... maybe one day..
Too bad it wasn’t a friends mom or maybe even step mom. The opening to a cheesy porno 
2 months?!
Your mom is a weird bitch bruh
Guess you had a free pass to jerk off all you wanted after that.
You should have blackmailed her
Fuck her for being a hypocrite 
Not happy, I now need the story of the old coach fighting the parent.
Mom wants to carch you masturbating (which is already creepy as fuck who WANTS to see their kids masturbate and goes out their way to see it?) All so she can punish you for it. Gets caught doing it herself amd STILL punishes you for it. She should be the one grounded lol. Should have played the "i wonder what dad/the parish/the vicar would say about this?" Card
Sounds like mom was needing some action.
Did she gain Ultra Christian Instinct?
Masturbation is the typewriter of the devil. Just so you know :)
Your mom fucking sucks. Gay af too. 
“I love catching people in the act, that’s why I’m always whipping open doors” 

-Dwight K Schrute
Grounding was unnecessary. Whenever I caught my parents doing something they told me not to do, I would complain loud and clear in front of everyone like they did with me. I never trusted my parents completely, and I still don't.
A lot of these stories involve people knowing there parents are against masturbation. Genuinely never once came up when I was staying at home.
right, like I think the only thing that was ever said to me about it was you need to start washing your own socks...
Can confirm ultra-religious parents are super freaks in private. It’s a hypocritical lifestyle to say the least. 
Dad was a pastor. 
How the tables have turned
Have you told her now that you know what she was doing
I read this skimming down the newsfeed and thought it said "Mum walked in on me masturbating" but then I realised and this was pretty much [my reaction](https://i.imgur.com/WjYJkW7.gif).
I came 
Am I the only one that finds it weird that this family was trying to catch each other jacking off? And then were surprised when it happened?
Oh lawd. That memory will be engraved fur sure. 
Am I the only one who thinks it's disturbing that his mom actively *tried* to catch her son masturbating, repeatedly? I mean how quick would that result in legal action if it were a father doing that to his daughter? Why should this be any different?
Side note for OP and everyone else who has had high impact experiences like this, it’s worth a little self reflection now and then to look at how they can inform or guide our own predilections and/or way of thinking.  Not trying to be gross or mean, just saying from experience that we can realize years later that they do have an impact.
She hot?
Another fine story of devout Christians who live the 'do as I say not as I do' mantra.  Maybe Jesus wanted this to happen so she's behave.
Came here for the broken arms comments, wasn’t disappointed.
you made my day lol . No longer depressed.

Typical religious people logic.


Thanks for my daily dose of cringe though, enough internet for today...
Yeah religion is like alcohol, a little is fine but too much brings a lot of regret
This makes me so mad for you. What a hypocrite. Whoever the piece of shit was who decided religion needed to be about denial of basic human biology needs his corpse re-animated so he can be murdered x1000. 
I think what you were witnessing, was **Napping With Jesus**™.

The only **Uptight White Evangelical Women**™ approved and recommended afternoon relaxation technique.

Guaranteed Pastor Jimmy approved!
I would have scolded her for being a hypocrite then yelled hail Satan!
I’d off myself if my parents were this strict 
Do people actually believe these stories? Lol
I swear I thought there was going to be broken arms in this story 
How old was your mom?  33 -39?
Please don't tell me you saw her vinegar strokes?
How old was your mom, and what did she look like? 
Sexy story. Is your mom hot? Did you see her bush? Hairy or shaved? Was she using a toy or her hand? Need details please
It was Mary from facebook if you've heard that story 
You may want to life once in a while..
In part 2 , he nails her , many times.

To be for fair,  Christians are allowed to masturbate if they're married and only lust after their spouse 
Most of them believe that sex is only for procreation, so since masturbation can’t result in a baby then it’s wrong. 
That's selfish. The world is too overpopulated. There's no evidence in the NT or the OT that sex for pleasure is a bad thing. 
I agree completely, but I was raised Catholic and had this preached to me all the time. Fortunately that only taught me that Christians are brain dead hypocrites and the whole belief system is bullshit. 
You know, General Santa Anna took a nap once and he lost the whole State of Texas. On this day, in fact, in 1836.

Awkward
but dude, I know you *think* that the new blade runner was better than the first. time & time again people associate beautiful cinematography with a “great movie” instead of putting more weight on a cohesive and interesting plot. 
Oh well
Why not join in?
But is she hot though?
Try knocking on the door before entering someone's room.
Did you even read the whole thing?
Yes, somehow. It was cringe-inducing.
Either way the point is that his mom would barge in without knocking so he did it back as a prank but it back fired. Reading your first comment makes me think you don't really know what you're talking about.
No. Other people acting badly doesn't mean he should.
Sometimes you have to teach people a lesson the hard way because just talking about it doesn't seem to work with some people..
Didn’t even read the story. Just take the damn upvote and my condolences. 
Sounds like a typical Christian
You are extremely immature and dumb. 
Get out of here, OP's mom! We know what you were doing!
I was fist deep and this little asshole comes barging in. Christ. 
Someone has done this to you eh? XD
You should have just taken advantage of the situation, filmed it and put it on the internet. 
7 downvotes and 7 boys or girls who couldn't admit to their own fetish. 

For shame. 
Fuck man, you don't knock?
Did you just skip to the end? Read it, you clod!
Fuck man, you don't read?
That’s the real victory
Get off me
Church women are the biggest freaks in bed. I know from experience. They can put on that mask all they want, but I can see right through it. Also, she was barging in on his room because she felt guilty about what she was doing. If a women thinks you are cheating and she won’t leave it alone, it means she’s actually cheating. People are so predictable lol.
You're on me? Edit plox
Yes. When I went to a friend's house for the first time and last time, she was showing me around her house and she barged in (swinging the door rapidly without knocking) on her teen son who was playing on his computer in his room. I asked her not to do that to me again as I would be mortified to see her son masturbating (as would he as he is a former student of mine) but she just laughed it off and said it was her house and her boys shouldn't expect privacy. I don't get this way of thinking at all. 
Or maybe she finally quit masturbation too
In
Fully aware.  Big thumbs and an iPhone results in typos.  As it sounds reads funnily I’m leaving it

Nope
And if he ever breaks his arms....
LMAO that's pretty much asking to be grounded for another 2 months 
Making sure to do the air quotes, too!
I think that might result in actual fucking death.
Unless you died as a child and never made it to adulthood, you should know that keeping teenagers from masterbating is impossible.


Or asked if she wanted to take a nap together sometime.
Should have asked if she needed a hand
Yea punishing you because she is embarrassed by touching herself? 
Agreed. Personally, I don't get why parents freak out about kids masturbating. Its teenage hormones, of course, they're gonna be curious. You teach them to have respect. Not bust into their room and then be a total hypocrite when they do the same. When you raise someone constantly breaking a boundary *, of course,* they are gonna assume it normal and fine to do that to people. This wouldn't have happened if parents talked to the guy about sexuality in a healthy way rather than demonizing it.
The grounding was worth it in exchange for that knock he gets now.
**Ultra-Christians don't take embarrassment well.**

*Edit: I'm going to shamelessly plug some brain science in here since this is taking off. The reason for this is because many are taught their religion and core beliefs with fear (often at a young impressionable age) and fear literally prevents logical and rational thought in the brain. So, if you've ever wondered why many (not all, of course) religious people can be so... umm... crazy-ish, it's because their brains are stuck in ~~Windows ME~~ an old abandoned poorly-built OS with tons of bugs.*

*Edit 2: I love some of your counter-arguments and invite you to do your own research on this theory. Get your brain juices flowing, Redditors. I know you're itching to prove me wrong. I know this theory isn't for every and all religious person and religions, but, there is a huge problem with applying such a broad label as "Christian" to beliefs and people.*
Aside from the masturbating, I was raised that a parents room was off limits. It was their space. Door shut? It can wait.

Knock always. 

Am 23 and still feel weird about going in their room.
2 months seems really excessive, but maybe if she punishes you enough her guilt will go away.
The obvious solution is to explain in detail why you are grounded whenever somebody asks. 
Right! The moment she would have tried to ground me we would have been have an ultra Christian talk and I'd have been calling dear old dad to fill him in on mom's downtime activities
Yeah what the fuck is up with the grounding part? That's some next level power-move shit. Reminds me of my dad. He was abusive to my mom but they split when I was very young. One day when I was like 12 I had the balls to ask him why he put his hands on my Mom. But it was just like a little innocent kid, "dad did you ever hurt my mom" and he became instantly furious and grounded me on the spot for being "disrespectful". Some parents do some fucked up dictator-like shit and I never even realized how messed up that was until I was older. At the time I foreal thought I was just being a bad...
The grinding is always necessary
Jesus wanted her to do it.
> My mom was always SUPER suspicious about my door being closed and what I was doing, so she would bust open trying to "catch me in the act".

Fucking projection man.
Not really, it sends a clear message not to talk about it ever.  
'I HAVE SEXUAL URGES AND THEREFORE YOU MUST BE PUNISHED! ' 

Sounds pretty standard for this particular kind of Christian. Or particular kind of religious person in general. 
Yeah that’s a Christian thing good old “I fucked up so I have to punish you to make you think fucked up.”
So was the bullshit about her disrespecting his privacy by trying to catch him doing something. My parents were very councious about my siblings and I's privacy, and lets be real what parent actually WANTS to catch their kid in the act?
Shame-grounding
Makes sense to keep up the lie though. If the story she is selling is that she was napping and he scared her, then he should be grounded for it.
Lol sounds like my life from 13-17. 

Mom: "take out the trash"
Me: "ok after this inning"
Mom: "no right now!"
Me: "ok fine"
Mom: "no talking back, you're grounded!"
OP, does your Dad know? she not getting enough action? or maybe she thought about you with broken arms  
Alternatively, OP is a big fat phoney, and made this shit up.
Fuck ultra strict christians
Seriously - I applaud you OP for taking the high road and just moving past it, but the whole hypocrisy of the situation is shitty enough, but for the whole trifecta of hypocrisy, denial when caught in the act, AND punishing you for it? That's weapons-grade bullshit.
A big part of Christianity, as it is understood and practised by the common people, tends to be about revenge. Nietzsche wrote extensively about that.
True but it was the Christian thing to do.
Clearly it was Gods will. 
Classic christian behavior. Wow.
Lmao, if anything, this is proof she was masturbating.
To be fair, his mom is clearly a POS of this story is 100% true.
I was grounded for an entire year once for quitting cheerleading because I was afraid the other girls didn't like me. We hadn't even had a first practice or ordered shoes/ outfits yet. It really sucked, but it taught me not to quit. 🤷‍♀️

Not quite the same circumstances though lol. 
Ikr he should have definitely fucked her mom... 
Heh. Crucify.
Like drinking....
Nah, it's still real weird, getting a kid to not jack off would be like turning back the tide
>Die-hard, anti-masturbation christians
*Door whips open*
LEMME SEE DAT DICK!
maybe she was hoping that she'd catch him in the act and scare him so much that he falls off the bed and breaks his hands ?
Parent here, would prefer my life go without witnessing such an event.. can't speak for all of them though.
It's not really a parenting thing it's more of a ultra-christian thing. 
No shit. Half my interactions with my teenager are me trying AVOID catching him masturbating. 
I'm a parent of 4 and I'd rather never, ever walk in on any of my kids doing that - ever. No thanks. Knocking FTW.
Yeah, that's incredibly disturbing. As a female if my father burst into my room trying to catch me masturbating it would seriously mess me up. 
I'm a mom of two boys and I would never ever do this when the time comes, pardon the pun. It's perverse. 
Reminds me of how Wendy Williams won’t let her teenage son close his door. 
It could be a porn scene.... 
People are so strange about their kids discovering their sexuality. I know my boys are going to discover porn some day. I know they’re going to start masturbating. Eventually they will most likely have sex with another person. My only real concern is that none of it is being done to an obsessive level and effecting other areas of their lives. 

And once I start finding crunchy socks, they’re doing their own damn laundry. 
It is.  I have a 16 year old boy, I ALWAYS knock, count to 3 and very slowly open the door.  I'm not naive and I don't want to walk in on that. I dont know what would be accomplished by "catching" him, besides awkwardness and humiliation for everyone involved, its really not worth it.
There was a guy at my friend's high school who was from Somalia. He was living with his aunt here since the rest of his family hadn't moved here. One day apparently he came in to school and told everyone his aunt was sending him back to Somalia cus she had cought him masturbating. Poor guy. 
The real question is: did op break his arms at some point 🤔
Christians
Do the ultra-christian types not know what Onanism is? Spilling your seed upon the ground - this is biblical.
Maybe it is turning her on.
I think the idea is not to catch someone in the act of doing anything wrong, but to discourage your child from doing anything they shouldn't behind closed doors.  It's like having random drug testing at work.
I think it's like if I have proof I can lecture him sort of thing 
>my parents are die-hard, anti-masturbation Christians

They do shit like that
Last time I saw a post with a parent doing that it ended with the kids being born into a cult, drug running, and police intervention.
Maybe she was hoping he would break his arms.
You're not a Christian. You wouldn't understand!!!
Well, what if he broke his arms or something?
She wanted to catch him so that she could help him out a bit, if ya know what I mean. I seen it a hundred times. 
When I have kids, I'll just be happy if I can teach them to do that stuff in their own rooms without getting mentally scarred.

IMO that's why parents get super into trying to keep their kids from masturbating. Kids are fucking stupid, and you have to teach them to not play with their genitals in the fucking living room, and some parents accidentally start trying to teach them not to play with their genitals *period* and then stubbornly hang on to that when it doesn't work.
Apparently my older sister did when she was very small. Mom just said "that's okay to do, but if you want to explore your privates, you have to do that in your bedroom." Problem solved. I didn't even know masturbation was a thing until 4th grade sex ed and mom asked if they mentioned masturbation. So, my mom is probably more relaxed about it than many.
He's gonna end up with broken arms.
Her arms weren't broken.
Or maybe that would have ended well for both of them? Amiright?
She jumped off of the bed to get the coconut from under the bed
> TL;DR. I busted in ... my ultra-christian mom ...
What about a Coconut?
It's not a story a Masturbating Redditor would tell you.
Or a fist?
For *scaring* her 
She was praying to god and he didnt want to pray that day. Grounded.

She is the ONE who knocks.
Not enough, she needs to be called out for being a backward hypocritical idiot.
Joke aside, she’s a fucking dick for doing that and it’s really unhealthy to be trying to catch your child “in the act.”

I really hate die hard Christians that do this shit to their children. Not trying to be the super edgy neckbeard atheist but I really dislike religion as a whole because it justifies actions like this to people.

Fuck religion imo. I mean trust in whatever you want, but no one knows what happens to your mind after death so living the wrong way only hurts you.

I hate it when people force others to do random stuff like do not masturbate, or saying that anything besides heterosexuality is wrong. 
This could've been the perfect response. He'd have gone from a son whose privacy was infringed everyday of his life to perhaps someone who gets some right to privacy 
yeah definitely unhealthy behavior on the parent's part
This needs more upvotes. 
Her behavior towards him is a reflection of the state of the relationship that she has with herself
From the sound of it, he still lives with them.. Eo that's probably not happening for a while.
Are you a robot? Why did you use woman and young man..? And who cares if it's biological

Yeah, it doesn't. Which is why you shouldn't pay any attention to how OP worded it. It's blatantly obvious that OP's comment wasn't meant to be a gender specific thing.
Changing "mom" to "woman" and "child" to "young man" made it sound pretty gender-specific to me.

How do?
What happens when you’re grounded? I’ve always heard Americans say that they were grounded by their parents but never understood exactly what that meant.

I’m not sure if it’s exclusively a USA thing or whether my parents just didn’t do it to me. 
Unfortunately alot of Christians are hypocrites. Thank you for actually staying true to your values and not just conveniently picking and choosing who gets to benefit or suffer and from what parts of the bible.
I can honestly never remember my parents ever apologizing for anything. It’s always an error in how someone else perceived what they did, and not an error on their part. I’ve found this to be incredibly common among the religious people I know. 
Bible also tells that majority of humanity will suffer eternally, so there is that. No reason to take that book seriously. 
Actually doesn't directly, took people a couple hundred years to abstract that idea from the New Testament scriptures.

The concept of that was brought in after Christianity started mixing with Roman government. The first theology of eternal damnation wasn't even conceived of until around 170 AD.
It is still in the Bible. And Christians believe in it. 100%, that is the reason they even are Christians. Afraid of the malevolent "God".
Reference?
"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned." -- John 15:6


"The Lord Jesus ... in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God ... who shall be punished with everlasting destruction." -- 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9


"The fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone." -- Revelation 21:8
Sorry. To clarify, I meant where does the Bible say the **majority** of people will suffer eternally? I know the Bible has quite a few passages in damnation and Hell.
The majority of people are disbelievers. Or do you not considerer disbelievers people?
It probably seems weird, but from my understanding, non-believers can still ultimately be saved.

  


  


Revelation 20:11-15

11Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them.

12And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done.

13And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done.

14Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.

15And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
Those quotes aren't clear and don't really mean anything. There may be some disbelievers thatt would go to heaven, but the majority will burn.
They're definitely not very clear (most prophecies in the Bible aren't until they pass, then 20/20 hindsight), but it doesn't say the majority will suffer (or be saved) either so I still can't say the Bible supports the claim that the majority of humans will be condemned. Another passage also hints that believers will ultimately be judged more strictly than non-believers (in this passage, Jews = believers, Gentiles = non-believers):

  


  


Romans 2:11-29

11For God shows no partiality.

12For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.

13For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.

14For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.

15They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them

16on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.

17But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God

18and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law;

19and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,

20an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—

21you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?

22You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?

23You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law.

24For, as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”

25For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.

26So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?

27Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law.

28For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.

29But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.
>As a Christian

Doesn't know anything about Christianity.
Just trying to learn a bit more. I don't know the part of the Bible you're referencing saying most people will not be saved.

EDIT: The closest thing I could find to most people not being saved was Like 13:23-30 where it says many will not be able to enter the kingdom of God:

23And someone said to him, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?” And he said to them,

24“Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.

25When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, open to us,’ then he will answer you, ‘I do not know where you come from.’

26Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’

27But he will say, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!’

28In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out.

29And people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God.

30And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”



The Bible shows God wants everyone to be saved. Ex: 1 Timothy 2:1-6:

 1First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,

2for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.

3This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior,

4who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

5For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,

6who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time.



The last part of 1 Timothy 2 is a source of a lot of controversy inside and outside of the Church about women's roles. I'm still learning but haven't come to a proper understanding for that part.



The Bible is misquoted and misreferenced all the time by Christians and non-Christians. I was asking for a reference because I for sure do not know even 10% of the Bible, but am currently trying to read through the whole thing. The reason I asked for a reference was because I am unaware of a passage that says most people will not be saved. Fun fact: I've heard the quote, "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger," used by Christians as if it was from the Bible when it's actually (and ironically) a quote from Nietzsche. 



TL;DR: Bible is misquoted a lot. I was unable to find a passage supporting /u/1836279402's claim that the Bible says most people will be damned.
Needed to break his arms first. 
He might have been able to get out of the grounding by   pointing out her hypocrisy, though I am not sure it would have been worth it in the end...
I think it’s just a dad thing to be an occasional asshole to their kid for laughs
Wut dafuq are they trying to achieve by infringing their privacy like that, those parents need to grow up.

Nothing in there about broken arms.
No
He'd have to break his arms first.
Good ol Christian guilt
Seriously; if you can't follow your rules, how can you be pissed that others do the same, much less punish them for it?

 I understand "my house my rules" just fine (that was sorta the type of house I grew up in), but you're expected to not be a hypocrite about those rules.
No no no, see. Only the parent has the right to barge in on you like that. You can't do it do them, that would be a no no. Silly child, thinking you're an equal.

-source had shit parents.
Pretty strong metaphor for the current state of the world.
Religion does crazy things to people.
Sounds pretty Christian to me. 
Seriously, what a bitch
He could have fought the punishment by bringing up the fact that she was masturbating.  Instead, nobody had an honest conversation about the truth, and everybody learned not to just barge into people's rooms.  

&nbsp;

People aren't perfectly rational, who'd've thought?  We still manage to cohabitate with each other fairly peacefully most of the time anyways though.
Christian family checks out.
Not all parents do. I won't care the least if my kids jerks off. Hell, I'll buy him lube and a Fleshlight. That would have been a dream come true when I was a kid, and by golly I want my child to have what I never did! 
I’m torn on this kind of thing because I feel like a lot of times teens think than they are having normal things demonized when they just aren’t being respectful. On reddit there are always a lot of “My dad caught me masturbating in his living room”, “My mom caught me having sex with my girlfriend in the kitchen”, or “My mom was SOOOO mad when she caught me using a controller from the family Wii as a dildo” and people often act like any reaction is an overreaction. 


Like, if I have kids I don’t care if they masturbate in their own rooms. I want them to feel like they are safe and have their own privacy. If they are disrespectful and disgusting I don’t know what I would do though. 


That’s another reason I don’t understand being crazy and cruel towards people doing normal things, like masturbating in a private space. I would much rather them do normal things than have to figure out what to do because my kid was genuinely doing inappropriate things and did not care. 
I read demonizing as demonetizing...guess too much pewds for me today
I’m religious and IMO, I can find no grounds for being anti-masturbation. It’s not the same as having sex with someone you aren’t married to, it’s also not devaluing of anyone involved. The only assumption I can make is that the attitude towards masturbation developed out of a need for power and control.
The masturbation itself isn't exactly the problem, it's the lust that inevitably comes with it, whether by watching porn or just having those kinds of thoughts.
People should respect personal boundaries to begin with 
Because it's clearly OP's fault that she was doing something she thought was wrong and fell utterly ashamed or disappointed at herself for not being able to keep her ludicrous standards and hands off herself

F.O.G. religions can't reason, literally. It goes against neuroscience and how the brain functions. It keeps a person stuck in fear-mode which puts people in perpetual fight-fight-freeze response and prevents logical thought and reasoning. Look it up. It's fucking scandal city.
Definitely not all religions. My Christian church was pro-science and anti-fear. We were taught how evolution (and all science for that matter) and Christianity were compatible. And we were never shamed for having premarital sex or being gay, we were taught how to be good people with love in our hearts. It’s such a shame when people take a good thing (faith and Christianity) and manipulate it into something dark. Illogical, and fear inducing.
I’ve always wondered, how do those kinds of churches reconcile the fact that they’re disregarding parts of the text their religion is based on?
>  it's because their brains are stuck in an old abandoned OS with tons of bugs.  

As a software developer I **LOVE** this description!!  May upvotes cascade on you like a JVM running out of memory.  
Haha!! 😍 Former coder and ultra-Christian here. I'm so happy one of you guys enjoyed this!

And, paleeze, I'm always upgrading my OS, coding, and getting the newest tech. I won't be running out of memory anytime soon. I hack my machine for fun. 😉

*'Be like a liquid-cooled CPU.' -Bruce Lee, probably*
Can confirm. Former UC.
Moreover, as we see in this case, they are not willing to understand how some of their own rules make no fucking sense. 
Well, it's because the ones making the rules are 'stuck' too. This is why unity among beliefs is so damn important. If your religion isolates you, it's fucked.
This is just a comment that not all religions use fear. My church teaches love for God, self, and neighbor, instead of a litany of donts-or-elses.
Yes, some religions are healthy, but many are not.
Yep. And I appreciate the language you used in your comment, that religious people 'can' think this way, instead of 'always do'.
Only Siths deal in absolutes. 😉
> **Only** Siths deal in absolutes.

Hmm....
Oooh, you caught it. 😉
that's a pretty accurate description
Wow, I really appreciate the comparison of my beliefs to an old buggy OS.

Don't make such ridiculously sweeping generalizations. There's no brain science showing that Christianity specifically is associated with a poor handling of embarrassment. People in general don't handle embarrassment well, especially when they're discovered to be hypocrites.
So uh, lets just kill religion? Like it seems to be one of the biggest problems preventing us as human kind from moving forward. We still have hate in ourselves just because people have a different religion. Fuckn crazy ik but we will be fine without it. Im a very nice boy and i live my life peacefully and happily never go to church and i never read one of their rule books. Im pretty sure im doing this life thing the correct way. Just be kind to everyone you meet never judge people and most of your problems will be solved. 
I didn't say kill religion. Some people need it, but I think teaching through fear is more damaging than beneficial. That's the point I was trying to make. I'm not anti-religion at all, I'm anti-abuse-in-the-name-of-religion.
What is the current brain OS? Lol
Some still run on Windows ME, some run on Linux, some run an old overly-priced artisan version. In my opinion, any religion that teaches to care for your fellow man, unity, etc. is generally a good one. Hippy 4.72?
Man, I could see this. I'm a Christian, but of my own will, not because of how I was raised. A LOT of Christians go about being Christian pretty backwards and it creates this fear of being judged and reviled for something that everyone else is doing anyway. 

It's an echo chamber about sin, and hatred, and biggotry, even though Jesus never asked for anything but love.
As someone who was raised in an ultra conservative household, yes it’s all based on fear. My mother was afraid of dying (her mom having died when she was young) so she clung to this puritanical Christianity that was so over the top that even friends and family members tried to tell her to cut it out. It’s still a problem to this day and a major center of contention between us. I feel bad for people like that to be honest, because they’re so scared of things they don’t understand that they need to find some over the top way to convince themselves that everything has rules and structure. They can’t face any sort of chaos. 
What if the trouble is more that almost all people react in stupid and often irrational ways to being embarrassed?

Or it could be that science proves you're more clever than your mom/religious ex/whoever hurt you.
I'm pretty sure most humans would be embarrassed by this. It's not about being Christian.
They don't take being exposed as hypocrites well
Best explanation of crazy ass religious folk.
Well, that could be any religious group.
Fucking Reddit. If this comment was about Muslims it would have been removed. However, Christian bashing is fair game. 
Nobody is bashing Christans.
Do you get paid to act like you what you’re talking about on Reddit or something? You replied quick as hell!!!
Nope, just a introverted loner enjoying my coffee on a Saturday morning. ☺️
Probably true.
 In my point of view the *non-believers* are evil!
That's because your parents liked to randomly bang in the middle of the day.
I'm somehow the only one knocking in my household. Living with Mom and two sisters. I told them to knock every time they bust in.
Now they open the door, and then knock.?
That’s how my kids are. If the door is open they’re welcome to come in. Door shut, means privacy 
Not if the parent dosent respect the kids privacy, they need to be trained on the importance of privacy, and having a parent that disrespects it so blatently is gonna cause the child to think it dosent matter to anyone.
That should go two ways though, at least from puberty onwards.
Do we really think dad doesn't know his wife masturbates?
Yeah I definitely did that on purpose... hahaha.. ha
On the anti masturbation cross no less

The one with straps to prevent self rape
I don't even see why parents disagree with it. Especially religious parents who would probably stone their kids to death if they turned homosexual.
"Fap goes in, fap goes out, you can't explain that."
According to some Christian dude "you can't explain how the tides work".
Apparently she's never heard of rubbing one out in the shower either. Unless she's randomly busting in on OP there too.
It is likely that she believes that somebody managed to do that as well
Soft socks go in room, petrified socks come out... You can't explain that!
I don't get people who try to stop it from happening, if I ever have a kid I'm always gonna knock in their door and give them the privacy 
Everytime I read about these kinds of parents, I cherish my mum more, and more! She's always been immensely open about sex which has really helped me grow as a person.


The funny part is that there are people who actually proclaim that aloud seriously. 
Aka Mormons 
well, it can be hard to not die hard without masturbation
That still doesn’t make it less weird. 
Reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/HHwvT4Xl5Uo) Samuel Johnson story (as told by Christopher Hitchens).
And then somehow be mad about what I know I’ll eventually find!  She gonna set a mousetrap every day in a dumpster and be pissed when she catches a mouse?
Adam Sandler has a hilarious skit along this vein. What the Hell Happened to Me album. 
Well what good would that be? Then she'd have to help him. Two broken arms is gonna make a boy that age irritable at the least. 
You remind of the guy who got himself injured & his mom jerked him off while he was out of commission ...
Not even that, they had full on sex till he was in college, even during his relationship with his first gf and the father was apparently super down with it. Everytime this comes up I get weirded out so much by this.
I agree, but I know for a fact it is going to happen.

Soooo, make sure to knock on doors and give em space.
Privacy locks are cheap.  Put them on before they're teens and then you won't have to explain it ever.  

Their mom would probably shit a brick but it's my house. 
Can confirm, my ultra christian mom did this to all three kids
That would be messed up, in more ways than one
My sister inlaw has twin boys and tries to police their porn genres after checking their browser history. She asked me about different genres of porn and what I think is acceptable. I explained the rabbit hole of what is today's porn. I said let them fap and that her giving them a list of what's acceptable is probably more fucked up sitituation then what their watching on their own as a whole. 
How long will this story plague reddit for?

Well this is kinda the opposite. So if her hands were broken...
Came looking for this. Didn't have to go far.
I think I saw a video of this happening somewhere...

Roll tide.
I mean, that would technically solve the problem since they wouldn't be masturbating.
It might have gone *okay*
Turns out the coconut was actually hidden in the couch

Even though it’s exactly what she had been doing to him multiple times.. it’s so backward and hypocritical.

I would actually love to upvote him twice, once for the pun and once because she seems like an unfair and unreasonable human being. She can fuck herself.

Please give the details. We are dying out here.
Yeah her grounding you is petty as shit. I think I would've brought up what she was doin if I were in your shoes and she tried to ground me after all that
Two months was pretty harsh. Shows how embarrassed she was. 
So what did your dad say about everything? He just came back and accepted the story that you are grounded for two whole months for not knocking and waking up mom from her nap?
you felt sorry for her?  because she was embarrassed?


She clearly has sexual issues 
I didn't grow up in a household infected by Christianity, but I like to think I would have leveraged myself in the situation, told her I knew, and if she didn't want word to get out at church she'd unground me and never barge in again. 
Bro you should have just told her you'd tell your dad/brother if she didn't drop it and you could both forget about it without grounding! Orrr get grounded extra for blackmailing your mom 
Sunday afternoons in my conservative Christian house growing up!
Is the euphemism really a worse thing than the truth? 

"Hey kid, I'm going to go fuck your mom". 
Believe it or not, my parents used to say exactly that. I knew it was true when the door was locked ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
not all but alot are
It's things like this that really give religion a bad name.  She lies, gets caught, and punishes the person for busting her... She has clearly learned nothing!
That was an earlier TIFU post
Oh man, I ate way too much turkey.  I'm going to go take a nap.
do post it though when it happens! "TIFU by sharing a *n* years old TIFU in Thanksgiving"
Don’t bring it up.  Some shit is irrelevant in life and not worth embarrassing someone you love...  just move on dude
Nah, it's better to use it when she tries to pull "don't do this because [insert untrue statement]", but be subtle in a way that she knows what your talking about without explicitly stating it (calling it a nap etc).

Maybe one day she'll realize the hypocrisy.
Shamma lamma ding dong
That's odd, with such an original joke, how did this happen...?

You're welcome.
uh.. that would be sharting
They dig a hole in the backyard and put you inside until you’ve learned a lesson. Whether that lesson be to behave differently, or how to climb.
It depends but in general it includes no access to your phone, computer or other technology and either you have an earlier curfew or you aren’t allowed to go out for anything other than school or work.
In the most basic terms it's "no having fun for X amount of time", which usually involves taking away computers/television/candy and enforcing a strict curfew.
Well in the UK banned means your not allowed to go on your consoles/computer grounded means your not allowed to go outside.
It's kind of like how Penis Inspection Day is a strictly American thing too. When you're grounded, you're forbidden from any form of masturbating for the given amount of time. Some parents take it to the extreme and use chastity belts, but that practice has been cut back a lot due to backlash in the last decade or so. 
My parents would ban me from any technology, reading books, hanging with friends, and watching tv. If i was at home, they would have me constantly clean all day. If i stopped cleaning they would extend my punishment. Nobody else would do any housework as long as i was grounded, and be as messy as possible with food and dishes and stuff. 

My experience probably isnt super common. My friends just had to stay in their room and read or something. Guess thats what i get for being a bookworm lol
My parents are Christians but not very religious (imo), but they've apologized to me in multiple occasions when they realize they've been unreasonable, which I'm grateful for. I'm assuming your parents are religious? I know a lot of people use religion to self-justify and end up cherry-picking parts of the texts to justify what they do, but have problems accepting the whole text because they (sometimes unconsciously) use religion selfishly instead of actually trying to pursue what the religion teaches. It's unfortunate and one of the reasons I set a goal for myself to read the whole Bible while taking notes.
My parents actually aren’t very religious either. My husband likes to explain it as being evangelical rather than being Christian. Evangelicals are more loud, in your face, and hypocritical AF because that stuff only applies to other people, not them. So there is definitely a split. 
Can this joke please fucking die?
Knowing a lot of very repressed Christians, growing up in the south, he may have taken a beating for pointing that hypocrisy out, as well. Never can tell.

Corner someone about something that they're so obviously and deeply ashamed of and who knows what shit you might be stepping in. 
Am Dad, can confirm.  

I wouldn't barge into their room (and like I've said before, they have privacy locks on their bedroom doors), but I will hide around corners and pop out asking HEY HOW'S IT GOING when they walk past.  

My daughter's 14 and it's funny to me every time when she goes AAAHHH because I jump-scared her again. 
is that actually true?

Of course it's not true. God has better things to worry about than your pubes. Also i heard he likes well groomed puss.

Meh he's alright, but he's no bowl of Special K
I might like OPs mom's tuna sandwich, but OP probably does not
Iono, there’s a market for either
I don’t know why by furiously masturbating is and will always be fucking hilarious to me
That's a win 
And then having two months where you can't even distract yourself with tv/phone
That's a win for me at least. :)
It's a double victory for r/incest ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Welcome to ultra-Christian (Catholicism) religions! 
Pretty much everybody is a hypocrite.  We often judge people in a given situation, without living their life up to that point to see how they got there.
"Do as I say, not as I do," is the attitude of many of these Christian types when they fuck up, trust me.
Indeed. I wouldn't be able to resist it... Even knowing the consequences. 
Oh absolutely
This one, op. This will turn it into a win. Please do this.

Good ol Christian hypocrisy 
You mean Christian hypocrisy?
The whole situation was born from ye olde Christian projection even.
On a general note \(of course, that are a lot of exceptions\) Christians make bad parents. Excessive grounding for absolute no fucking reason.
[deleted]
Christian and conservatives do this?  You sure you want to revisit this comment lol?
Which part do you disagree with? 
Just funny you are labeling the wrong people that fit your symptoms lol... victimizing, personal disorder, raging when people disagree with them... sounds like a totally different group of people which I’m sure you fall in... 
You're both right! When a person bases their whole identity on a narrow (religious, political, etc.) idealogy, it feel like a personal attack when anybody criticizes those beliefs. Life lesson: be more open minded.
>but you're expected to not be a hypocrite about those rules.

Hahahahaha... whew, good one! 
Honestly, if you expect someone who’s described as a “die hard, anti masturbation Christian” to not be a hypocrite, you’re gonna be in for a shock every time. 
Everyone has different expectations.

&nbsp;

The my house my rules mindset also isn't totally unfair, in most cases, even when it's done in a hypocritical manner.

&nbsp;

Parents typically raise children from birth, for a relatively long time, financially and in a caring manner.  Most parents also wish well for their children, even if they don't understand what that is.  Even the seemingly unfair/biased/hypocritical rules are probably to help the supporting individuals (parents) cope with doing the supporting role, as they often have many difficult decisions to make on a regular basis, and expend large quantities of energy and effort to fulfill that support.

&nbsp;

Even though we have laws now to enforce parents taking care of their offspring, the reality is that there is no guarantee for any individual to take care of another one.  I would even suggest it's impossibly for any individual to truly care for all of the needs and wants of another individual in a healthy way.
My mom didn’t like me locking my bedroom door because she worried I would die while someone couldn’t help me. She never actually checked that I was alive though.


My dad was like “if you’re ever doing something you think I don’t want to know about or see, lock the door”. And he still knocked. He was crazy in other ways but I was always glad he wasn’t like some of the other kids parents who took their doors away for locking them. 
Do as I say, not as I do!
[deleted]
So, if you bring a child into this world... you can treat them how you like because it’s ‘your world’? 
Apparently, this kind of logic makes sense to some. It’s justifying abuse, and that isn’t ok
It's "their world" in India. Rape your kids. Have your friends rape em too! Right!? You worded that badly. 
All right, this isn't even worth it. Your parents barging into your room is rape? Ok
Hey its me ur son
My ex had a 16 yo boy.  They had a very open relationship and he asked his mom for a sex toy for Xmas or his bday, I forgot which.  She had no idea what to get, so I recommended the fleshlight since I heard good things.  Sure enough she got it for him.  I joked with her that his younger bro is gonna sneak off and borrow that shit.  She thought that was funny.  Different kind of family than OP’s.  
Makes me wonder what the dad does on his "work trips" 🤔 
It's really illogical. Whether your kid catches you or not, isn't God always watching you?
This was my childhood. I cannot tell you how many times I got spanked/punished for them getting caught in their shameful behavior. F.O.G. (religion based in fear, obligation, and guilt) religion can be insanely toxic to a normal human brain. It breaks people in the wrong ways.
I could hug you for saying this. 
He got grounded because she was being a dirty slut.  /S
The grounding happened because she thought OP took the bait and assumed Mom was asleep, so Mom has to demonstrate that she is in the right by grounding OP for reasons she made up
Plenty of times, but the shame always came after I did.
Yeah, I'm a former ultra-Christian. 😉
Nah. You can't be embarrassed if you refuse to acknowledge that you were wrong. 
Yes please, I feel like being raised in fear all the time really fucked me up, here I am 23 and unable to work because if anything gets a smidge too stressful I break down and panic. The therapy program I'm in is going to take a year and they said I basically have to unlearn 23 years of false information/ feedback.

Don't do religion, kids

Edit: mine was half super religious, half abuse and trauma. Also parents were split and that was a nightmare in itself because I had to pack up and move every single week.
Just researching this stuff on your own would greatly benefit your own thoughts, but here's a couple to get your brain juices flowing: [Is religion based on fear?](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/dec/02/bertrand-russell-philosopher-religion-fear-christian) and [How Terror Hijacks the Brain](http://healthland.time.com/2013/04/16/how-terror-hijacks-the-brain/).

**But, I highly suggest reading the scientific studies if you can comprehend them.**
I highly suggest a memory wipe and a complete rebuilding of your OS then. Former degenerate here too and I can tell you that CBT will be insanely beneficial to your future. Just because you get rid of the religion, doesn't mean you've dumped old coding.
This was actually in my original joke, but I didn't want to go there.
Here's a couple of basic articles, but I suggest reading the more science-y ones if you can comprehend them.

[The Power of Emotions to Override Rational Thought](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/overcoming-destructive-anger/201611/the-power-emotions-override-rational-thought) and [How Terror Hijacks the Brain](http://healthland.time.com/2013/04/16/how-terror-hijacks-the-brain/). Often religion is taught young and uses fear as a foundation for compliance. I can also speak from experience as I've undergone deprogramming of ultra-Christianity (*cough, cough, CULTS, cough, cough*) and the difference is night and day.
Neither do most people.

Source: am a human being.
Absolutely! I personally had to go through deprogramming from cult-like Christianity, but it did take a couple of years. I'm so much healthier mentally now and am so happy I did it.
who doesn't?
Start jerking off all the time until they catch you. That should slow them down.
But i hope you arent hiding hypocrisy from them
I’d be willing to bet with the level of sexual suppression in that house neither parent knows that the other does it.

http://www.versiondaily.com/the-anti-masturbation-cross/

My mom found my vibrator when I was 15 or 16 (she was helping me look for something in my room and came across it). I had a very religious upbringing so I froze, expecting the worst. 

Turns out she was actually supportive of me having one to relieve sexual tension, apparently because vibrators don't come with the threat of pregnancy or STDs. 
Well... when you think about it, having sex with yourself (stroking dick if you’re male, and vice versa) could be considered homosexual by the most twisted religious people. 
You're trying to use logic. If that worked, they wouldn't be fundamentalists. 
not sure how being homosexual relates to not masturbating? 
In Christianity, a lot of things related to sex is frowned upon. I guess it follows the thought that suffering is good, as Jesus suffered, and in this short life we have, we should serve God and suffer for him and show that we're worthy to go to Paradise. Suffering is good in Christianity, so I guess they would also be opposed to having pleasure.
Not my experience just what I’ve read in a sub One person was saying how his grandmother caught him whacking and was extremely upset and believed he was gay bc he was touching a dick

Actually someone made this joke before me further down the thread. The link is already there. 
I warned my mom about this. She had a "No locked doors" policy, but then refused to knock. So i just locked the door when i needed to anyway. Shed threaten to take the door off its hinges and id tell her, "then youre gonna see some shit you really don't want to see.
That last bit is important; "*knockknockopensdoor*" is not the same as "*knock-knock, can I come in?... Opens door*."

I never said my ideas were *good* lol 
Some people love their mom enough to take the punishment and save her from embarrassment..
Some parents love their kids enough to not be idiots and ground them for no reason
Some people are human are overreact and make mistakes
And when you do you apologize, especially to your kids, and not actually keep it in effect for 2 months. Like saying that and going back and apologizing a couple days later
& she took out all her frustrations on OP.

When I was a kid and watching the simpsons I thought it just meant “go to your room” but never saw the point because that’s where all the toys/consoles are that my parents wouldn’t be assed to unplug in the first place
I'm in the US but this is what it meant in my family
That's true 
I was the original the fast and the furious. 
Reminds me of [Chappelle's skit about the homeless man beating it on the bus](https://youtu.be/xzs_VkACuZk?t=124)
Same, I think its because my mind associating Furiously Masturbating to beating on your dick like in a comical way
But why would she be furiously masturbating? In her mind she had all day to get that wank out. Take your time with it, love yourself, make it count. 

Furious masturbation is for when you texted your friend you left the house already but you *really* need that nut before you meet up because you know Sarah is going to be there in her low cut top again and you've already been caught looking before.
I was raised Catholic but my parents weren't this crazy. Then again, the Catholicism comes from my step-dad and my mom just went with the flow (she had the final say on punishments) so I guess I got off relatively easy.
Most of the Catholics I know are pretty chill about the whole thing. Baptists though. This is American South btw
Idk I think evangelicals are worse... most of the Catholics I've met are very casual about their faith.  They attend mass and confess sins, but that's about it.
I really, really want to meet a non-hypocritical ultra-religious person someday.  It just seems like no one can live up to standards like that.
Really? Most of the ultra conservative wackos in the US are Protestant? I say this as a Protestant.
Lol ultra Christians in the US aren’t catholic they’re either Protestant or nondenominational 
My family is all super Roman-Catholic to the point where when my father passed they had the full bells and whistles traditional funeral at the church and I've never experienced any of this kind of stuff. It's totally possible to be crazy for Jesus/God and not be absolutely obsessive and controlling.
Most American derivatives of the Christian faith come from Puritans, those guys were all about shame, fear and taking the Bible literally.
I think this is more a thing of certain protestant sects rather than Catholics, these days
Religion is pretty dumb.  Christ never talked about masturbation specifically anyways.  Rather, he did the right thing and discussed intent.

No
Are you a penguin?
No.  Christ never taught people to be guilty.  Quite the contrary, he told people to take his peace with them, and told people to go forth and sin no more.  He also explicitly forgave people, on God's behalf, because that was the right thing to do, and everyone deserves forgiveness.  Which of us recalls choosing to be born here and deal with the difficult things we do?
I still don't believe those people are real. Then again, I come from a country where 60% of the population is a non believer so maybe I'm biased ?

As with most religious prohibitions, God has nothing to do with it. It’s easier to forgive yourself for hypocrisy if you’re never caught. 
> isn't God always watching you?

Not just God.  ;)
Christianity gives you an out for exactly this sort of thing. She can just tell herself that she's not perfect, just forgiven. 
even though I've grown into an atheist, being raised by super-conservative Christians has definitely ruined me in some ways, to this day.
So sorry to hear you experienced that! Reading this and the above comment makes me really glad I was raised in a non-fear based very pro-science Christian church and family. My parents were always telling me that the Bible should not be taken literally and what’s important are the moral lessons it teaches not the literal rules. When I first had sex my mom found out and it was embarrassing but she was actually super cool about it. She told me she left some “literature” on my desk about it. Instead of finding anything scary like “sex always leads to pregnancy and STDs” or something against premarital sex, she left articles about how important it is to be respected and to have your needs met by your partner. Granted I was 2 weeks away from turning 18, but I still thought this was really cool of her and wish more Christian parents would acknowledge that sex is normal and not scary, and to love their kids no matter what
Catholics give the best spankings *wink

Hell this is literally the reasoning behind why male circumcision was brought to the Western World for the first time a few hundred years ago. Crazy religious parents wanted to stop their sons from masturbating. (crazy thought # 1) And they thought if they circumcised them, they physically would be incapable of masturbating anymore. (crazy thought # 2) 

But that was back in simpler times, when the West was ultra Christian, and believed sexual thoughts and acts physically polluted the body. So yeah, fun times... 
what did you plug?
/shudder

glad to read that you have seen the light.
But if you're familiar with the scientific literature, could you point to a study which makes claims that vaguely resemble yours?
I quite liked your first citation here, but after reading it one thing still bothers me. Isn’t it already pretty obvious that religion is based on fear? The whole concept of sin and eternal damnation, fire and brimstone, etc. seems pretty scary to me, which is why I imagine it’s been so effective for so long. I grew up in a church that preached this so maybe it’s just my experience but I feel like this idea should already be common knowledge. 

Edit: Not all religions 
I've heard that this is a reason why spanking doesn't work as well for learning rather than using rational explanations alongside non-violent punishment. You're teaching through fear rather than logic, which can affect how a child learns through adulthood.
I'm not saying you're wrong, but the the second link you provided is specifically about PTSD following a traumatic event. 

It may very well be that religious teaching does employ fear and PTSD in their indoctrination but your link doesn't indicate that or even mention religious teaching. 

The first link is more on point but it seems to be more the authors opinion and he doesn't provide any sources. 

Do you know of any primary sources indicating that religious teaching is a form of PTSD that causes the "emotional brain" as your first source put it to over-ride rational thought?
I think you mean Catholicism, right? Wait... there's no difference? 
Speaking from experience isn't good enough to draw that link. Rational thinking going down with high emotion is fine, and you've backed that up. But you seem to make a lot of assumptions about religion and how this links to emotions in the long term that you can't back up with empirical evidence. I'm not religious myself, but I think you're particularly biased against religion for whatever reason.
Great argument. I invite you to a healthy debate, but I would like to link psychology, neuroscience, and religion together. (Please note, that I am not a black and white thinker, so I do know that my argument will not work in **all** cases, as with most science.)
No, just Catholicism is a cult much like scientology. But not protestant, baptist, Lutheran, Episcopalian or methodist denominations.
Can confirm.

Nah. They know that closed doors mean private time, for us and for them. They’re still fairly young (8 and 9) but we’re pretty open with them about things in a (hopefully) non-therapy requiring way.

Genuinely curious and I hope this doesn't come off in a weird way, but how did a 16 y/o raised in an ultra-religious household get a vibrator without anyone knowing?

Well, I'm assuming this was before the rise of Amazon, etc.
This is the real winner here. My parents where the same way. 
I am glad you got that reaction. I didn't. I got the expected grounding and shaming. I was never allowed to close my bedroom door and was only allowed to crack the bathroom door, but never close it. It was RIDICULOUS. 
That’s why you have to say no homo before crucifying your holy sausage 
>and vice versa

Dick stroking you?
There’s a video I saw by either the Mormon’s or the Jehovah’s Witnesses that was teaching their members about the dangers of masturbation. It began as you would expect but then slowly shifted into weird homoerotic territory. Like, just because a dude likes to crank one out every now and again doesn’t mean he wants to let his brother in faith sit on his lap and lick his earlobes. And then the monotone delivery and deadpan eyes just enhanced the awkwardness of the whole thing. 
you are one of those people that don't know how to use vice versa 
This is why i make a vagina out of my armpit and finger that. ^/s
I don't think I've ever seen any religion make that claim even the most extreme ones. 
Technically, I'm gay. I've enjoyed touching 100% of the dicks I've touched... I've only touched my own. 
[It's true tho.](https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/internet-pastor-dave-daubenmire-masturbation-homosexuality/#gs.O017qDo)
Masturbating means I have to touch my dick. Touching dicks is gay. Miss me with that gay shit.
Well girls like dudes and liking dudes is gay, that means girls are gay. So if you like a girl, that's gay because liking a gay person is gay.
tbh when i suck my own dick and swallow the cum it makes me feel kinda gay.
Fellas, is it gay to masturbate? I mean, you are touching a dick like???
best comment I've seen in a long time
Everyone knows "a jerkoff per day keeps the gay thoughts at bay"!
Both are things the Bible frowns on if you follow the archaic parts. 
Both are sexual acts done out of what they consider wedlock; same fundamental issue as premarital sex, as I understand.
Touching dicks is super homo, including your own.  ^/s
Well, I think you are correct to a certain extent. For most Christians in my social circle, masturbation usually leads to lustful thoughts about a woman or man. This is why we see it as wrong, not because it gives us pleasure. But I think you are correct in that the Church looks down on anything involving sex. It pushes people away, when in reality we should be spending an equal amount of time removing selfishness and jelousy from congregations. 
That's actually not it, in case you're genuinely wondering. 

It's about the idea that all sex is supposed to happen within a marriage, and that idea comes from the notion that a family is supposed to have both parents; in Christian theology (or at least Catholic theology), the concepts of sex, family, and marriage are all intimately linked.

This is also why Catholics (and a number of other denominations) take issue with premarital sex and contraceptives; both of those break the "marriage/sex/kids" triangle.
____
edit: As a side note (while we're on the topic of possible misconceptions), Catholicism actually considers sex to be the most God-like act that we're capable of, since sex lets us create human life, which Catholics understand to inherently have an immortal soul. Catholics get so hung-up on sex not because they hate it but because they find it literally sacred. 

Unfortunately this is more of a specific church teaching and not a biblical one. Paul says “I rejoice in my suffering” but also says those who intentionally punish themselves or are harsh on their body are false in their humility and actually just worshipping themselves. (See Colossians 2:23). Salvation is a gift and therefore any attempt to try gain it or be worthy for it is a false teaching. Yes the Bible does say we must set our minds on higher things and aim to be good but it also says: “Don’t be over righteous neither be overwise, why destroy yourself” Ecclesiastes 7:16.  Some churches have overemphasized some verses or twisted their interpretation. So just because you have been exposed to an incorrect version of Christianity, doesn’t mean the religion is wrong, it just means you need a better teacher or should just look into this stuff yourself :)
Ah.  Canadian here.  Just remembered it being one of the dumbest lines I had heard in a very long time.
At least with this one it's to be expected. 
Do you want to see your hairbrush in his ass? 
My parents would take the door down a lot (dad was abusive, not masturbation related), so I’d edge myself in the door frame and climb to the top of it and casually read a book up there. Uncomfortable as hell but the pettiness was worth it

Except making her feel guilty about masterbating is just as petty and the exact opposite thing he should have done. He should have just told her he knew what she was doing and pointed out the hypocrisy of grounding him for doing exactly what she did to him all the time. 
Well, not _all_ of them.
how she feels is her problem

i got a problem for her lashing out at the OP because *she* was doing something *she* perceives as wrong


yeah, she's also dishonest and disingenuous
And their mom. You're thinking logically about an emotional connection.
i wonder at what point the average person decides that someone with whom they have an emotion connection has crossed a line and the relationship is forever altered


Guessing OP didn't hit that point over being grounded
i agree.  

i know the point at which i reached it.  i was an adult and it was for something nowhere near what the OP experienced.


You can share if you wanna get it off your chest.
my mom was an atheist who told me she cried at my wedding because i married a catholic

this wasn't in ireland during the Troubles.  this was in 1996 in the northeastern US.

i knew how she felt, i just had the misguided hope she'd be able to keep quiet about it.

she couldn't

it was at that point, i decided i was done with my mother


There certainly is a point, but grounded isn't thaaat bad. 
Oh no, I'm not trying to say it is.

Fair enough. I can't speak for all Catholic people I guess. The Pope seems pretty cool. 

I'm still recovering from Catholic inflicted trauma from my last relationship. I was pretty easy going until F.O.G. was projected onto me by my ex. Made me feel guilty about a lot of things I did. I still do them now, but I can't help but feel slightly triggered when I do them.

Oh I fucking assure you, they are abundant in the United States and other highly religious countries

The Mormons even have interviews with their local leader as a youth where they ask you if you're keeping "clean" sexually. I'm sure other churches have their own ways of shaming sex and masturbation. It's all a bit wonky 
I'm from the southern US, in a rural area overrun with southern baptists. I've never met these anti-masturbation proponents in 20 years here. It's always been one of those "just don't acknowledge it exists" type of deals. At least, that's the case for those outside my age group

I’m still struggling with the whole being gay thing, I have this irrational hatred of it in myself that my parents were so kind to give me

Luckily I think I might be on the path to recovery...
My husband was raised in a very strict Catholic household. He had so much guilt baked in in regards to sex that he had to go to therapy to work through it. When his sisters wound up pregnant before getting married his mother blamed him because he was living with his girlfriend and setting a bad example as the oldest kid...

We’re atheists, but there’s still a lot of guilt that he carries because of his upbringing, and same for me though I was raised Non Denominational Christian. I often joke that I’m the only person in my family in 10 generations who experiences guilt because they saved it all up to pour into me. Religion is so fucked up. 
I fully believe in a higher power, but I believe that power is nature/ mother nature /the cycle of life. I don't really talk about it much cause it's my thoughts and feelings. But my mother is and was a hardcore Catholic who made my life hell. So I kind of get how you feel I guess. You doing okay now?
I grew up Orthodox Jew. I cant shake a lot of the guilt. I still dont eat pork or shellfish, and I have no idea why. I don't keep or believe anything else.
In what ways has it ruined you? I was raised super-conservative as well and now lean towards atheism. I don't share the same sentiment. Do you want to talk about it?
lol not particularly, but i guess if I had to say, some things would include a propensity to care way more than I should about how others think of me (lest they or the Lord think I'm some sort of slut/loser/bad christian/etc); an unhealthy deference to authority/inability to take criticism (since the Lord's word was law and any wrongdoing was not just a slip up, but also a transgression to be added to the list of things the Lord would judge me on); I missed out on a lot of normal childhood things like PG-13 shows/movies/music since my parents were so protective against anything the Lord would find sinful. it also turned me into a closet nymoho when I was a teenager, since everything about sex was so fucking taboo in my household that I went buckwild as soon as I learned anything new about it.
>being raised by super-conservative Christians has definitely ruined me in some ways, to this day.

Not all religions, no. Many Christians teach fire and eternal damnation while some teach love and the light. It's like politics having a right and left.
That's a very Christianoty centric viewpoint, plenty of religiona don't have that viewpoint.
That’s very true. Perhaps I shouldn’t have generalized so much, though I was under the assumption we were already discussing these types of Christian denominations in this thread. 
That’s part of the reason.  Another part is that the child quickly learns that there cannot be any punishment without a punisher, so what they should have “learned” through punishment isn’t properly generalized to situations where the punisher is absent.
Yep. Bingo.
This explains the viewers of Fox ~~News~~ Entertainment.
Doing your own research is very good for your brain, so I'm not going to go into much more than this, but fear/terror is how many religions teach. I was attempting to get the readers to connect the two together. There is applicable science in that article, I wasn't talking about all of it. I highly suggest reading the science studies if you can comprehend them, but not all can, so I posted a basic starting point.
Well you made the claim and said the science supported it so I figured you had a source. My bad. 


I can't tell if you're trolling me, but many religions base their teachings in fear and fear turns off logical thought in brains. Are you really not making a possible connection?

How about this?: [Is religion based in fear?](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/dec/02/bertrand-russell-philosopher-religion-fear-christian) (and yes, I know not *all* religions and religious people function this way).

Again, I'm not going to tell you what you believe and invite you to do your own research. If you don't want to, that's okay too. Your choice.

The Old Testament is basically a set of guidelines on how to lead a primitive tribe to grow as fast as possible. 

Thus it includes suggestions like banning homosexuality (which doesn't pop out kids), masturbation (likewise), suicide (lowers community morale and mental health), and eating lobsters (some dude turned red and died because of it, I'm pretty sure that means it's forbidden)

Meh, I fell out of faith after high school. Personally I find all religion to be flawed. Specific beliefs aside, they can work well as a social construct for encouraging community and social conduct, but in practice they tend to get over-zealous and over-extend their reach which I find incredibly problematic. As long as you try to be a good person it shouldn't matter what you do with yourself in private.

I agree, this does seem possible.
To open about the trauma is a whole other thing though. I was taught as a Christian to love all life, and still try to live by that as an agnostic. But I'll be damned if I said Transgender people deserve to live their lives peacefully. Many people go crazy BECAUSE they fear others animosity over something as benign as looking how they want and bieng their true selves.

And yeah, I get its more than dress up, but I can't imagine feeling like I'm a man or woman but bieng looked down on because I'm striving to achieve that image externally. 

Hell, I get terrified just when I wear a colorful button down because I'm worried friends will think I'm gay - like that's somehow a bad thing - or I'll lose social standing, maybe women will look sideline me.

If you don't think that wouldn't effect you or it's bullshit, I dare a straight male to go and tell their buddies or some women they're interested in that they like to achieve prostate orgasms via dildo, but they're not into men.  It's that fear of judgement that restricts so many many lives.

And you don't have to be gay lesbian, trans whatever to empathize with those people. Just takes a bit of thought.
Yes it is! Are you young? I was raised in a super catholic little town and always attended bible study and awful things like that.

It can take a while but we live in great times where you have a lot of freedom.

I think it's possible to masturbate without lust, but it's so hard to do that masturbation is simply considered a sin at this point. I don't think the physical act of masturbation is a sin.

if you mean her - i don't think it has anything to do with religion.

parents get used to being seen as "all knowing" by their children.  some have a hard time dealing with it when their kids find out they are fucked up and fallible ... ya know, human.

Her, not you. We can agree to disagree, but I think the religious element plays a huge role here. She finds masturbation shameful because of her religion. She's caught doing what she deems wrong and projects the punishment onto her kid. 
i think blaming it on religion is just too easy

i think is the fault of human nature

YMMV and that's cool
Lol how is "it's human nature" any less easy of a response than "it's religion"?

Honestly, the bible doesn’t really talk about being transgender— but some pastors stretch the fuck out of “pornea” to include “devious behavior” which allows them to justify their bigotry in Jesus. It’s fucking bullshit but it’s one of the thousands of contradictions of Christianity that allows the followers to pick and choose to suit whatever narrative they need at any time.

As a trans person, it’s really frustrating, but most of the time I just ignore it, and pretend like they’re not the largest voting block in the United States. :/
Sounds like you need to gain more confidence in yourself. I used to have those thoughts, but at some point you realize it doesn't matter, and if you're friend or the girl you're interested in would say something about your purple shirt, they're not worth your time.

My girlfriend and guy friends alike have both complemented bright pink and green shirts of mine. Some have made jokes. It just doesn't matter one way or another.

Not the same as being transgender obviously that's a whole nother level of judgement by ignorant assholes.
Oh I know I've got low self esteem, wearing what I want helps build it and enjoy the shirts. I definitely worry too much though, but work in progress I say.

This is exactly it. I'm in my 40s so my wallet is completely empty of fucks to give, but even in my late teens/early 20s, I knew that I was more than happy to stand up for myself and whatever I thought was right.
